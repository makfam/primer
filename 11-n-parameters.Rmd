<!-- Temperance. Answer the question. Be aware of the limits to the accuracy of your answer. Testing. All the cool themes. Bring it all together. Make the students say "Ahhh!" Revisit the three levels of possible knowledge:

First, God knows the ideal Preceptor Table, and so can calculate each individual's treatment effect, and any summary measure like the average. 

Second, we have DGM Posterior, which is the posterior you would calculate if you had perfect knowledge of the data generating mechanism, meaning you have the correct model structure and exact beta values. With that, you could not be certain about any individual's causal effect, because of the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference. But, you can still calculate posterior's for unknown numbers, and those posteriors would be perfect.

*This chapter is still a DRAFT.*

Having created models with one parameter in Chapter \@ref(one-parameter), two parameters in Chapter \@ref(two-parameters), three parameters in Chapter \@ref(three-parameters), four parameters in Chapter \@ref(four-parameters) and five parameters in Chapter \@ref(five-parameters), you are now ready to make the jump to $N$ parameters. 

In this chapter, we will consider models with many parameters and the complexities that arise therefrom. As our models grow in complexity, we need to pay extra attention to basic considerations like validity, population, and representativeness. It is easy to jump right in and start interpreting! It is harder, but necessary, to ensure that our models are really answering our questions. 

Imagine you are running for Governor and want to do a better job of getting your voters to vote. How can you encourage voters to go out to the polls on election day? 


## Wisdom

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Wisdom"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Wisdom.jpg")
```

As you research ways to increase voting, you come across a large-scale experiment showing the effect of sending out a voting reminder that "shames" citizens who do not vote. You are considering sending out a "shaming" voting reminder yourself. 

We will be looking at the `shaming` dataset from the **primer.data** package. This is dataset is from "Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment" by Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008). [Check out the paper here](https://github.com/PPBDS/primer.data/blob/master/inst/papers/shaming.pdf). You can, and should, familiarize yourself with the data by typing `?shaming`. 

Recall our initial question: how can we encourage voters to go out to the polls on election day? We now need to translate this into a more precise question, one that we can answer with data. 

Our question:

*What is the causal effect, on the likelihood of voting, of different postcards on voters of different levels of political engagement?*

### Ideal Preceptor Table

Recall the ideal Preceptor Table. What rows and columns of data do you need such that, if you had them all, the calculation of the number of interest would be trivial? If you want to know the average height of an adult in India, then the ideal Preceptor Table would include a row for each adult in India and a column for their height. 

One key aspect of this ideal Preceptor Table is whether or not we need more than one potential outcome in order to calculate our estimand. Mainly: do we need a causal model, one which estimates that attitude under both treatment and control? The Preceptor Table would require two columns for the outcome. In this case, we are trying to see the **causal effect** of mailed voting reminders on voting.

Are we are modeling (just) for prediction or are we (also) modeling for causation? Predictive models care nothing about causation. Causal models are often also concerned with prediction, if only as a means of measuring the quality of the model. Here, we **are** looking at causation. 

So, what would our ideal table look like? Assuming we are running for governor in the United States, we would ideally have data for every citizen of voting age. This means we would have approximately 200 million rows. 

Because there is no missing data in an ideal Preceptor Table, we would also know the outcomes under both treatment (receiving a reminder) and control (not receiving a reminder). Here is a sample row from our table:


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = 'left'}
library(tidyverse)

# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(ID = c("Citizen 1", "Citizen 2"),
       ytreat = c("0", "1"),
       ycontrol = c("1", "1"),
       yeffect = c("+1", "0")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(ID = md("ID"),
                ytreat = "Behavior in Treatment",
                ycontrol = "Behavior in Control",
                yeffect = "Treatment effect") %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(ID)))  %>%
  tab_style(style = cell_text(align = "left", v_align = "middle"), 
            locations = cells_column_labels(columns = vars(ID))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = vars(ID)) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "Outcomes", columns = vars(ytreat, ycontrol, yeffect))
```
In our ideal table, we have rows for **all American citizens of voting age**. This is a good start! However, we may want even more information in our ideal Preceptor Table. Perhaps a column for sex would be informative. A column for age? Political affiliation? In a perfect world, we would know all of these pieces of information. In a perfect world, we could measure the *exact causal effect* of voting reminders for different subsets of the US population.

We may also want to narrow our ideal Preceptor Table. If we are running for governor in Florida, we may only want to study citizens in Florida. If we are running as a Democrat, we may only want to study citizens who are registered Democrats. 

There's also the fact that even the ideal Preceptor Table is subject to errors. For instance, by the time we actually *do* the simple math to calculate the exact treatment effect of our reminders, lots of people in our table would have died --- yet they are included! Lots of people also would have crossed over into the voting age --- yet they are excluded. 

However, the main point of this exercise is to see *what we want to know* compared with *what we actually do know*. 

### EDA of `shaming`

After loading the packages we need, let's perform an EDA, starting off by running `glimpse()` on the `shaming` tibble from the **primer.data** package. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(primer.data)
library(rstanarm)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggdist)
library(gt)
library(janitor)
library(broom.mixed)
library(gtsummary)
```

```{r}
glimpse(shaming)
```


`glimpse()` gives us a look at the raw data contained within the `shaming` data set. At the very top of the output, we can see the number of rows and columns, or observations and variables respectively. We see that there are 344,084 observations, with each row corresponding to a unique respondent. This summary provides an idea of some of the variables we will be working with. 

Variables of particular interest to us are `sex`, `hh_size`, and `primary_06`. The variable `hh_size` tells us the size of the respondent's household, `sex` tells us the sex of the respondent, and `primary_06` tells us whether or not the respondent voted in the 2006 Primary election. 
There are a few things to note while exploring this data set. You may -- or may not -- have noticed that the only response to the `general_04` variable is "Yes". In their published article, the authors note that "Only registered voters who voted in November 2004 were selected for our sample" (Gerber, Green, Larimer, 2008). After this, the authors found their history then sent out the mailings. Thus, non-registered voters are excluded from our data.

It is also important to identify the dependent variable and its meaning. In this shaming experiment, the dependent variable is `primary_06`, which is a variable coded either 0 or 1 for whether or not the respondent voted in the 2006 primary election. This is the dependent variable because the authors are trying to measure the **effect** that the treatments have on voting behavior in the 2006 general election.

<!-- HV: Should I include discussion of the left-hand variable (treatment?) here? Or wait until we move into the regressions? -->

We have not yet discussed the most important variable of them all: `treatment`. The `treatment` variable is a factor variable with 5 levels, including the control. Since we are curious as to how sending mailings affects voter turnout, the treatment variable will tell us about the impact each type of mailing can make. Let's start off by taking a broad look at the different treatments.

<!-- HV: Is it okay to say the first sentence of this paragraph? -->

```{r}
shaming %>%
  count(treatment)
```

Four types of treatments were used in the experiment, with voters receiving one of the four types of mailing. All of the mailing treatments carried the message, "DO YOUR CIVIC DUTY - VOTE!". 

The first treatment, Civic Duty, also read, “Remember your rights and responsibilities as a citizen. Remember to vote." This message acted as a baseline for the other treatments, since it carried a message very similar to the one displayed on all the mailings.

In the second treatment, Hawthorne, households received a mailing which told the voters that they were being studied and their voting behavior would be examined through public records. This adds a small amount of social pressure to the households receiving this mailing.

In the third treatment, Self, the mailing includes the recent voting record of each member of the household, placing the word "Voted" next to their name if they did in fact vote in the 2004 election or a blank space next to the name if they did not. In this mailing, the households were also told, “we intend to mail an updated chart" with the voting record of the household members after the 2006 primary. By emphasizing the public nature of voting records, this type of mailing exerts more social pressure on voting than the Hawthorne treatment.

The fourth treatment, Neighbors, provides the household members' voting records, as well as the voting records of those who live nearby. This mailing also told recipients, "we intend to mail an updated chart" of who voted in the 2006 election to the entire neighborhood.

### Population

One of the most important components of Wisdom is the concept of the "population". Recall the questions we asked earlier:



As we have discussed before, the population *is not* the set of people, or voters, for which we have data. This is the dataset. Nor is it the set of voters about whol we would like to have data. Those are the rows in the ideal Preceptor Table. The population is the larger --- potentially much larger --- set of individuals which include both the data we have and the data we want. Generally, the population will be much larger than either the data we have and the data we want.  

In this case, we are viewing the data from the perspective of someone running for Governor this year that wants to increase voter turnout. We want to increase turnout **now**, not for people voting in 2006! We also may want to increase turnout in those citizens who are not registered to vote, a group that is excluded from our dataset. Is it reasonable to generate conclusions for this group? Most likely, no. However, we have limited data to work with and we have to determine how far we are willing to generalize to other groups. 

It is a judgment call, a matter of Wisdom, as to whether or not that data we have is “close enough” to the population we are interested in to justify making a model.

Even though the original question is about “voters” in general, and does not specifically refer to specific states in which we might be interested, we will assume that the data we have for random voters is, uh, representative enough of the population we are interested in. If we did not believe that, then we should stop right now. *The major part of Wisdom is deciding what questions you can’t answer because of the data you just don’t have.*

### Can we answer this question?

<!-- DK: Shouldn't the key points here be moved into Justice? Delete the rest? We end Wisdom by making our population assumption, and stating that population cleanly. "The population of interest" is all registered voters for Gubernatorial elections in US states from 2000 through 2030. -->

<!-- Answering questions about representativeness and validity is only possible if you have specified your population precisely. The more narrow the population you choose, the easier it is to make assumptions about representativeness and validity. The more broad your population, the more useful your model. -->

Often in Wisdom, we consider the failings of our data and press on. However, this is a good time to consider what it really means to accept that our data is relevant to our question. With that in mind, let's break down our real, current question: 

* We are running for governor in the year 2021. In this year and in the United States, we consider sending out a voting reminder postcard to citizens of voting age. Will this reminder encourage voting, and by how much?

Now, let's break down our data from the `shaming` dataset:

* The data was gathered in Michigan prior to the August 2006 primary election. The population for the experiment was 180,002 households in the state of Michigan. The data only included those who *had* voted in the 2004 general election. Therefore, it did not include non-voters. The reminders were mailed to households at random. 

So, how similar are these groups? Let's start with some differences.
* The data is from 2006. Our question is asking for answers from 2021. This is not a small gap in time. A lot changes in a decade and a half!
* The data excludes all non-voters in the last election. Our question, which seeks to increase voting turnout *in all citizens*, would want for non-voters to be included. So, can we make any claims about those citizens? Probably not.
* The data only includes voters from Michigan. We may want to make inferences about other states, or the United States as a whole. Is it within reason to do that?
* The voting reminders in the data were sent by mail. Is this the most practical option in 2021, where it may be easier to send an electronic notice? 
* The contents of voting reminders in 2006 are going to differ from voting reminders sent in 2021. Thus, our "treatments" are fundamentally different.

These are not small issues. These are big, in-our-face issues. If we say that data from voters in 2006 and data from voters in 2021 is exchangeable --- meaning that they represent the same thing --- we also have to consider what that means for other time frames. Can data from 2006 be used to predict for 2030, 2040, and beyond? What makes 2021 an acceptable option specifically?

It can be helpful in cases like these to make data exchangeable conditional on another assumption. For instance, if there was a trend of less voting in 2021 compared with 2006, we may need to account for that in order for our predictions to be helpful. Alternatively, if we were studying a state that has historically more voting participation than Michigan, we may want to make our predictions based on the assumption that "people, on average, vote more in State X."

The purpose of this section is to make us think critically about the assumptions we are making and whether those assumptions can be reasonably made. Though we will continue using this dataset in the remainder of the chapter, it is clear that we must make our predictions with caution.

<!-- DK: Add discussion of what you see here. No need to drop missing values since there aren't any. I think this next discussion can be dropped. -->

<!-- DK: Note that this situation is different from Chapter 8 in that fitted values and predicted values are not the same thing! The fitted value, for a combination of values for treatment and solo, is something 0.30, meaning that 30% of the people in this bucket votes. But the predicted value must be 0 or 1. Either you voted or you didn't. This example is clearly causal and so you need a Rubin Table with 5 potential outcome columns. The key difference in this chapter is that we are using lots of right hand side variables, both continuous and discrete. -->


## Justice 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Justice"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Justice.jpg")
```

Justice emphasizes a few key concepts: 

* The actual Preceptor Table, a structure which includes a row for every unit in the population. We generally break the rows in the actual Preceptor Table into three categories: the data for units we want to have, the data for units which we actually have, and the data for units we do not care about. 
* Is our data representative of the population? 
* Is the meaning of the columns consistent, i.e., can we assume validity? 

We then make an assumption about the data generating mechanism. 

### Actual Preceptor Table

Recall that in an actual Preceptor Table, we will have a bunch of missing data! We can not use simple arithmetic to calculate the causal effect of voting reminders on voting behavior. Instead, we will be required to estimate it. This is our estimand, a variable in the real world that we are trying to measure.An estimand is not the value you calculated, but is rather the unknown variable you want to estimate.

Let's build a basic visualization for the actual Preceptor Table for this scenario:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table

tibble(subject = c("Citizen 1", "Citizen 23", "Citizen 40", "Citizen 53", "Citizen 80"),
       ytreat = c("Voted", "Did not vote", "?", "?", "Voted"),
       ycontrol = c("?", "?", "Voted", "Did not vote", "?"),
       ydiff = c("?", "?", "?", "?", "?")) %>%
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("ID"),
                ytreat = md("Treatment"),
                ycontrol = md("Control"),
                ydiff = md("Treatment - Control")) %>%
  cols_move(columns = vars(ytreat, ycontrol), after = vars(subject)) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_style(style = cell_text(align = "left", v_align = "middle", size = "large"), 
            locations = cells_column_labels(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = vars(subject)) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)  %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$\\text{Outcomes}$$", vars(ytreat, ycontrol))  %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "$$\\text{Estimand}$$", vars(ydiff))
```


Here, there are two possible outcomes: did vote or did not vote. What we really want to know is the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the treatment, the voting reminder. We want to estimate how much the voting reminder impacts the odds of someone voting. 

Note that this is a simplified version of the actual Preceptor Table. In this dataset, we have a number of other columns that we know about each of our subjects: age, sex, past voting history. In an expanded actual Preceptor Table, these columns would be included. 

Now, how can we fill in the question marks? Because of the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference, we can never know the missing values. Because we can never know the missing values, we must make assumptions. “Assumption” just means that we need a “model,” and all models have parameters.

To fill in these blanks, we need to perform some datascience. This part of the process is included in courage. Let's take a look!

<!-- Justice: Actual Preceptor Table. Then, representativeness (rows), validity (columns). Only the main functional form, with no variable names. Discussion of the error term. --> 

## Courage
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Courage"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Courage.jpg")
```


### Set-up

Now, we will create an object named `object_1` that includes a 3-level factor classifying voters by level of civic engagement. 

* Convert all primary and general election variables *that are not already 1/0 binary* to binary format. 

* Create a new column named `civ_engage` that sums up each person's voting behavior up to, but not including, the 2006 primary. 

* Create a column named `voter_class` that classifies voters into 3 bins: "Always Vote" for those who voted at least 5 times, "Sometimes Vote" for those who voted between 3 or 4 times, and "Rarely Vote" for those who voted 2 or fewer times. This variable should be classified as a factor.  

* Create a column called `z_age` which is the z-score for `age`. 

```{r object_1}
object_1 <- shaming %>% 
  
  # Converting the Y/N columns to binaries with the function we made note that
  # primary_06 is already binary and also that we don't need it to predict
  # construct previous voter behavior status variable.
  
  mutate(p_00 = (primary_00 == "Yes"),
         p_02 = (primary_02 == "Yes"),
         p_04 = (primary_04 == "Yes"),
         g_00 = (general_00 == "Yes"),
         g_02 = (general_02 == "Yes"),
         g_04 = (general_04 == "Yes")) %>% 
  
  # A sum of the voting action records across the election cycle columns gives
  # us an idea (though not weighted for when across the elections) of the voters
  # general level of civic involvement.
  
  mutate(civ_engage = p_00 + p_02 + p_04 + 
                      g_00 + g_02 + g_04) %>% 
  
  # If you look closely at the data, you will note that g_04 is always Yes, so
  # the lowest possible value of civ_engage is 1. The reason for this is that
  # the sample was created by starting with a list of everyone who voted in the
  # 2004 general election. Note how that fact makes the interpretation of the
  # relevant population somewhat subtle.
  
  mutate(voter_class = case_when(civ_engage %in% c(5, 6) ~ "Always Vote",
                                 civ_engage %in% c(3, 4) ~ "Sometimes Vote",
                                 civ_engage %in% c(1, 2) ~ "Rarely Vote"),
         voter_class = factor(voter_class, levels = c("Rarely Vote", 
                                                      "Sometimes Vote", 
                                                      "Always Vote"))) %>% 
  
  # Centering and scaling the age variable. Note that it would be smart to have
  # some stopifnot() error checks at this point. For example, if civ_engage < 1
  # or > 6, then something has gone very wrong.
  
  mutate(z_age = as.numeric(scale(age))) %>% 
  select(primary_06, treatment, sex, civ_engage, voter_class, z_age)
```

Let's inspect our object: 

```{r}
object_1 %>% 
  slice(1:3)
```
Great! Now, we will create our first model: the relationship between `primary_06`, which represents whether a citizen voted or not, against sex and treatment. 

### primary_06 ~ treatment + sex


In this section, we will look at the relationship between primary voting and treatment + sex. 

*The math:*

Without variable names:

$$ y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i, 1} + \beta_{2}x_{i,2} ... + \beta_{n}x_{i,n} + \epsilon_{i} $$
With variable names: 

$$ y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}civic\_duty_i + \beta_{2}hawthorne_i + \beta_{3}self_i + \beta_{4}neighbors_i + \beta_{5}male_i + \epsilon_{i} $$

There are two ways to formalize the model used in `fit_1`: with and without the variable names. The former is related to the concept of Justice as we acknowledge that the model is constructed via the linear sum of `n` parameters times the value for `n` variables, along  with an error term. In other words, it is a linear model. The only other model we have learned this semester is a logistic model, but there are other kinds of models, each defined by the mathematics and the assumptions about the error term. 
The second type of formal notation, more associated with the virtue Courage, includes the actual variable names we are using. The trickiest part is the transformation of character/factor variables into indicator variables, meaning variables with 0/1 values. Because `treatment` has 5 levels, we need 4 indicator variables. The fifth level --- which, by default, is the first variable alphabetically (for character variables) or the first level (for factor variables) --- is incorporated in the intercept.


Let's translate the model into code. 

```{r, cache=TRUE}
fit_1 <- stan_glm(data = object_1,
                  formula = primary_06 ~ treatment + sex,
                  refresh = 0,
                  seed = 987)
```

```{r}
print(fit_1, digits = 3)
```


We will now create a table that nicely formats the results of `fit_1` using the `tbl_regression()` function from the **gtsummary** package. It will also display the associated 95% confidence interval for each coefficient.

```{r, message = FALSE}
tbl_regression(fit_1, 
               intercept = TRUE, 
               estimate_fun = function(x) style_sigfig(x, digits = 3)) %>%
  
  # Using Beta as the name of the parameter column is weird.
  
  as_gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**Likelihood of Voting in the Next Election**"),
             subtitle = "How Treatment Assignment and Age Predict Likelihood of Voting") %>%
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008)")) %>% 
  cols_label(estimate = md("**Parameter**"))
```

Interpretation: 
* The intercept of this model is the expected value of the probability of someone voting in the 2006 primary given that they are part of the control group and are female. In this case, we estimate that women in the control group will vote ~`r round((coef(fit_1)["(Intercept)"] * 100), 1)`% of the time. 
* The coefficient for `sexMale` indicates the difference in likelihood of voting between a male and female. In other words, when comparing men and women, the `r round(coef(fit_1)["sexMale"], 3)` implies that men are ~`r round((coef(fit_1)["sexMale"] * 100), 1)`%  more likely to vote than women. Note that, because this is a linear model with no interactions between sex and other variables, this difference applies to any male, regardless of the treatment he received. Because sex can not be manipulated (by assumption), we should not use a causal interpretation of the coefficient. 
* The coefficients of the treatments, on the other hand, do have a causal interpretation. For a single individual, of either sex, being sent the Self postcard increases your probability of voting by `r round((coef(fit_1)["treatmentSelf"] * 100), 1)`%. It appears that the `Neighbors` treatment is the most effective at ~`r round((coef(fit_1)["treatmentNeighbors"] * 100), 1)`% and `Civic Duty` is the least effective at ~`r round((coef(fit_1)["treatmentCivic Duty"] * 100), 1)`%. 


### primary_06 ~ z_age + sex + treatment + voter_class + voter_class*treatment

It is time to look at interactions! Create another model named `fit_2` that estimates `primary_06` as a function of `z_age`, `sex`, `treatment`, `voter_class`, and the interaction between treatment and voter classification. 

The math: 
$$y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}z\_age + \beta_{2}male_i + \beta_{3}civic\_duty_i + \\ \beta_{4}hawthorne_i + \beta_{5}self_i + \beta_{6}neighbors_i + \\ \beta_{7}Sometimes\ vote_i + \beta_{8}Always\ vote_i + \\ \beta_{9}civic\_duty_i Sometimes\ vote_i + \beta_{10}hawthorne_i Sometimes\ vote_i + \\ \beta_{11}self_i Sometimes\ vote_i + \beta_{11}neighbors_i Sometimes\ vote_i + \\ \beta_{12}civic\_duty_i Always\ vote_i + \beta_{13}hawthorne_i Always\ vote_i + \\ \beta_{14}self_i Always\ vote_i + \beta_{15}neighbors_i Always\ vote_i + \epsilon_{i}$$
Translate into code: 

```{r fit_2, cache = TRUE}

fit_2 <- stan_glm(data = object_1,
                  formula = primary_06 ~ z_age + sex + treatment + voter_class + 
                            treatment*voter_class,
                  family = gaussian,
                  refresh = 0,
                  seed = 789)

```

```{r}
print(fit_2, digits = 3)
```

As we did with our first model, create a regression table to observe our findings: 

```{r table_2}
tbl_regression(fit_2, 
               intercept = TRUE, 
               estimate_fun = function(x) style_sigfig(x, digits = 3)) %>%
  as_gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**Likelihood of Voting in the Next Election**"),
             subtitle = "How Treatment Assignment and Other Variables Predict Likelihood of Voting") %>%
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008)")) %>% 
  cols_label(estimate = md("**Parameter**"))
```

Now that we have a summarized visual for our data, let's interpret the findings: 
* The intercept of `fit_2` is the expected probability of voting in the upcoming election for a woman of average age  (~ 50 years old in this data), who is assigned to the Control group, and is a Rarely Voter. The
estimate is `r round((coef(fit_2)["(Intercept)"] * 100), 1)`%. 
* The coefficient of z_age, `r round(coef(fit_2)["z_age"], 1)`, implies a change of ~`r round((coef(fit_2)["z_age"] * 100), 1)`% in likelihood of voting for each increment of one standard deviation (~ 14.45 years). For example: when comparing someone 50 years old with someone 65, the latter is about `r round((coef(fit_2)["z_age"] * 100), 1)`% more likely to vote.
* Exposure to the Neighbors treatment shows a ~`r round((coef(fit_2)["treatmentNeighbors"] * 100), 1)`% increase in voting likelihood for someone in the Rarely Vote category. Because of random assignment of treatment, we can interpret that coefficient as an estimate
of the average treatment effect. 
* If someone were from a different voter classification, the calculation is more complex because we need to account for the interaction term. For example, for individuals who Sometimes Vote, the treatment effect of Neighbors is `r round(coef(fit_2)["treatmentNeighbors"] + coef(fit_2)["treatmentNeighbors:voter_classSometimes Vote"], 1)`%. For Always Vote Neighbors, it is `r round(coef(fit_2)["treatmentNeighbors"] + coef(fit_2)["treatmentNeighbors:voter_classAlways Vote"], 1)`%. 

## Temperance

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Temperance"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Temperance.jpg")
```

Finally, let's remember the virtue of Temperance. The gist of temperance is: be humble with our inferences, as our inferences are always, certainly, and unfortunately not going to match the real world. How does this apply to our shaming scenario?

Recall our initial question: *What is the causal effect, on the likelihood of voting, of different postcards on voters of different levels of political engagement?*

To answer the question, we want to look at different average treatment effects for each treatment and type of voting behavior. In the real world, the treatment effect for person A is almost always different than the treatment effect for person B.

In this section, we will create a plot that displays the posterior probability distributions of the average treatment effects for men of average age across all combinations of 4 treatments and 3 voter classifications. This means that we are making a total of *12* inferences. 

*Important note*: We could look at lots of ages and both Male and Female subjects. However, that would not change our estimates of the treatment effects. The model is linear, so terms associated with `z_age` and `sex` disappear when we do the subtraction. This is one of the great advantages of linear models. 

To begin, we will need to create our `newobs` object. 

```{r plot_2}
# Because our model is linear, the terms associated with z_age and sex disappear
# when we perform subtraction. The treatment effects calculated thereafter will
# not only apply to males of the z-scored age of ~ 50 years. The treatment
# effects apply to all participants, despite calling these inputs.


sex <- "Male"
z_age <- 0
treatment <- c("Control",
               "Civic Duty",
               "Hawthorne",
               "Self",
               "Neighbors")
voter_class <- c("Always Vote",
                 "Sometimes Vote",
                 "Rarely Vote")

# This question requires quite the complicated tibble! Speaking both
# hypothetically and from experience, keeping track of loads of nondescript
# column names after running posterior_epred() while doing ATE calculations
# leaves you prone to simple, but critical, errors. expand_grid() was created
# for cases just like this - we want all combinations of treatments and voter
# classifications in the same way that our model displays the interaction term
# parameters.

newobs <- expand_grid(sex, z_age, treatment, voter_class) %>% 
  
  # This is a handy setup for the following piece of code that allows us to
  # mutate the ATE columns with self-contained variable names. This is what
  # helps to ensure that the desired calculations are indeed being done. If you
  # aren't familiar, check out the help page for paste() at `?paste`.
  
  mutate(names = paste(treatment, voter_class, sep = "_"))

pe <- posterior_epred(fit_2,
                        newdata = newobs) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  
  # Here we can stick the names that we created in newobs onto the otherwise
  # unfortunately named posterior_epred() output. 
  
  set_names(newobs$names)
```

Now that we have our `newobs` to work with, we will need to create an object named `plot_data` that collects the treatment effect calculations. 

Recall that, when calculating a treatment effect, we need to subtract the estimate for each category from the control group for that category. For example, if we wanted to find the treatment effect for the Always Vote Neighbors group, we would need: Always Vote Neighbors - Always Vote Control. 

Therefore, we will use `mutate()` twelve times, for each of the treatments and voting frequencies. After, we will `pivot_longer` in order for the treatment effects to be sensibly categorized for plotting. If any of this sounds confusing, read the code comments carefully. 


```{r}
plot_data <- pe %>% 
  
  # Using our cleaned naming system, ATE calculations are simple enough. Note
  # how much easier the code reads because we have taken the trouble to line up
  # the columns.
  
  mutate(`Always Civic-Duty`    = `Civic Duty_Always Vote`     - `Control_Always Vote`,
         `Always Hawthorne`     = `Hawthorne_Always Vote`      - `Control_Always Vote`,
         `Always Self`          = `Self_Always Vote`           - `Control_Always Vote`,
         `Always Neighbors`     = `Neighbors_Always Vote`      - `Control_Always Vote`,
         `Sometimes Civic-Duty` = `Civic Duty_Sometimes Vote`  - `Control_Sometimes Vote`,
         `Sometimes Hawthorne`  = `Hawthorne_Sometimes Vote`   - `Control_Sometimes Vote`,
         `Sometimes Self`       = `Self_Sometimes Vote`        - `Control_Sometimes Vote`,
         `Sometimes Neighbors`  = `Neighbors_Sometimes Vote`   - `Control_Sometimes Vote`,
         `Rarely Civic-Duty`    = `Civic Duty_Rarely Vote`     - `Control_Rarely Vote`,
         `Rarely Hawthorne`     = `Hawthorne_Rarely Vote`      - `Control_Rarely Vote`,
         `Rarely Self`          = `Self_Rarely Vote`           - `Control_Rarely Vote`,
         `Rarely Neighbors`     = `Neighbors_Rarely Vote`      - `Control_Rarely Vote`) %>% 
  
  # This is a critical step, we need to be able to reference voter
  # classification separately from the treatment assignment, so pivoting in the
  # following manner reconstructs the relevant columns for each of these
  # individually. 
  
  pivot_longer(names_to = c("Voter Class", "Group"),
               names_sep = " ",
               values_to = "values",
               cols = `Always Civic-Duty`:`Rarely Neighbors`) %>% 
  
    # Reordering the factors of voter classification forces them to be displayed
    # in a sensible order in the plot later.
  
    mutate(`Voter Class` = fct_relevel(factor(`Voter Class`),
                                     c("Rarely",
                                       "Sometimes",
                                       "Always")))

```


Finally, we will plot our data! Read the code comments for explanations on aesthetic choices, as well as a helpful discussion on `fct_reorder()`.

```{r}
plot_data  %>% 
  
  # Reordering the y axis values allows a smoother visual interpretation - 
  # you can see the treatments in sequential ATE.
  
  ggplot(aes(x = values, y = fct_reorder(Group, values))) +
  
  # position = "dodge" is the only sure way to see all 3 treatment distributions
  # identity, single, or any others drop "Sometimes" - topic for further study
  
    stat_slab(aes(fill = `Voter Class`),
              position = 'dodge') +
    scale_fill_calc() +
  
    # more frequent breaks on the x-axis provides a better reader interpretation
    # of the the shift across age groups, as opposed to intervals of 10%
    
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1),
                       breaks = seq(-0.05, 0.11, 0.01)) +
    labs(title = "Treatment Effects on The Probability of Voting",
         subtitle = "Postcards work less well on those who rarely vote",
         y = "Postcard Type",
         x = "Average Treatment Effect",
         caption = "Source: Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008)") +
    theme_clean() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

This is interesting! It shows us a few valuable bits of information:

* We are interested in the average treatment effect of postcards. There are 4 different postcards, each of which can be compared to what would have happened if the voter did not receive any postcard. 
* These four treatment effects, however, are heterogeneous. They vary depending on an individual's voting history, which we organize into three categories: Rarely Vote, Sometimes Vote and Always Vote. So, we have 12 different
average treatment effects, one for each possible combination of postcard and voting history. 
* For each of these combinations, the graphic shows our posterior distribution.

What does this mean for us, as we consider which postcards to send? 
* Consider the highest yellow distribution, which is the posterior distribution for the average treatment effect of receiving the Neighbors postcard (compared to not getting a postcard) for Always Voters. The posterior is centered around 9% with a 95% confidence interval of, roughly, 8% to 10%. 
* Overall, the Civic Duty and Hawthorne postcards had small average treatment effects, across all three categories of voter.  The causal effect on Rarely Voters was much smaller, regardless of treatment. It was also much less precisely estimated because there were many fewer Rarely Voters in the data. 
*The best way to increase turnover, assuming there are limits to how many postcards you can send, is to focus on Sometimes/Always voters and to use the Neighbors postcard. 

*Conclusion*: If we had a limited number of postcards, we would send the Neighbors postcard to citizens who already demonstrate a tendency to vote. 

How confident are we in these findings? If we needed to convince our boss that this is the right strategy, we need to explain how confident we are in our assumptions. To do that, we must understand the three levels of knowledge in the world of posteriors. 

### The Three Levels of Knowledge 

There exist three primary levels of knowledge possible knowledge in our scenario: God's Posterior (the ideal Preceptor Table), the DGM Posterior, and Our Posterior. 

#### God's Posterior

God's Posterior is the posterior if we had all the knowledge we need to *directly* answer our question. In short, God's posterior is built with the ideal Preceptor Table. God, equipped with the ideal Preceptor Table, can calculate each individual's treatment effect, and any summary measure we might be interested in, like the average treatment effect. 

This posterior represents the highest level of knowledge one can have --- with it, our questions merely require math. No estimation. 

#### DGM Posterior

The DGM Posterior is the posterior we would calculate if we had perfect knowledge of the data generating mechanism, meaning you have the correct model structure and exact beta values. 

With that, you could not be certain about any individual's causal effect, because of the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference. As a brief reminder: we can never measure any one person's causal effect because we are unable to see a person's resulting behavior under treatment *and* control; we only have data on one of the two conditions. 
Regardless, we can still calculate posterior's for unknown numbers, and those posteriors would be perfect. 

#### Our posterior




<!-- What we need to add: Preceptor table, causal explanation, math before models, posterior_epred. -->

## Summary

*Key commands*:
* Use the `tidy()` function from the **broom.mixed** package to make models with $N$ parameters easier to interpret. 
* A function we are familiar with, `stan_glm()`, is used to create models with $N$ parameters. 

*Remember*:
* It is important to remember that the data does not equal the truth. 
* The population we would like to make inferences about *is not the population for which we have data*. It is a matter of wisdom whether the data we do have maps closely enough to the population we are studying.
* When dealing with models with many parameters, double check that you know how to find the true slope and intercepts --- often, this requires adding numerous values to the coefficient you are studying.
