# This file contains all the important settings for creating the book.
# Think of it as its brain. By adding entries to this file, we can change
# the appearance and functions of our book. Besides entries in this file,
# bookdown also gives us the possibility to make entries in index.Rmd. It
# doesn't matter which entries are put in _output.yml and which in index.Rmd.
# The result is the same in both cases. Only note that entries in _output.yml
# are simply placed anywhere within the file, whereas in index.Rmd they have
# to be placed in the YAML header (that is, between the two - - - ). This file
# has been created manually, though most of the entries here are from Hadley
# Wickham's repos and https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/.

# This first-level entry specifies output options in case the book is built
# using the "bs4_book" theme. At the moment, two second-level specifications
# are made: "theme" and "repo". With "theme" we can individualize the theme
# more precisely, but currently only "primary" is used to specify the primary
# color of the book. A color can be specified in the form of a hex code. The
# second second-level option, repo, specifies the URL of the repo, which can
# then be called via a button in the book.

bookdown::bs4_book:
  theme:
    primary: "#C90016"
  repo: https://github.com/PPBDS/primer

# Output options if the book is created in gitbook format. "css" can be used
# instead of "theme" to point to a css file. This will then be used for the design.
# "config" contains a whole set of options that change the user-interface. These
# do NOT seem to work for bs4_book, which is why it was omitted above. The first
# one is the "toc" option, which can be used to customize the table of contents.
# For this we use "collapse" to set the level at which the table of contents should
# be collapsed when the page is loaded. Possible levels are "subsection", "section"
# or "null". With "edit" we can define the URL through which a user can make changes
# to the book. Changes can only be made or suggested by users who have access to the
# repo. The "download" option defines the formats in which a reader can download a
# section of the book. The "sharing" option can be used to specify social media for
# sharing sections of the book; others than the three below can also be specified.
# For a detailed overview of possible config-options, see
# https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html.html.

# Output options if the book is created in PDF format. R Markdown documents are
# converted to PDF by first converting to a TeX file and then calling the LaTeX engine
# to convert to PDF. By default, this TeX file is removed, however if you want to keep
# it (e.g., for an article submission), you can specify the keep_tex option.

bookdown::pdf_book:
    keep_tex: yes

# Output options if the book is created in epub format.
