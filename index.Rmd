# Welcome {.unnumbered}

<!-- nocite: '@*' is what ensures that all the references appear. Not sure why! -->

<!-- Need a new cover. Sirens will do for now. Format more like Mastering Shiny?-->

This isn't the book you're looking for.

```

First, the book is for students in [Gov 1005: Big Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005_spring_2021.html), a course offered in the Government Department at Harvard University. Everything about the book is designed to make the experience of those students better. I hope that some of the material here may be useful to people outside of this class.

Second, the book changes all the time. It is as up-to-date as possible. The later chapters are still in draft.

Third, I am highly opinionated about what matters and what does not. You might not share my views.
