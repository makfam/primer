      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, DUID reports the identifier assigned by MEPS to the person's Dwelling Unit (DU), sampled for MEPS data collection. DUID is a random ID number assigned after the DU was sampled for MEPS and does not change once assigned. The MEPS sample [URL omitted from DDI.] is a subset of the households that participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 

DU definitions are generally consistent with NHIS definitions of households. For example, the 2018 NHIS Survey Description [URL omitted from DDI.] document describes households as "occupied housing units" (p. 10) that exclude "long-term care institutions (for example, nursing homes for the elderly, hospitals for the chronically ill or physically or intellectually disabled, and wards for abused or neglected children), correctional facilities (for example, prisons or jails, juvenile detention centers, and halfway houses)." (p. 8). Additionally, "unless one other family member is a civilian eligible for the survey (for example, a child whose parents are both active-duty military)" (p. 8), housing units occupied by active-duty Armed Forces personnel are also excluded from the survey. 

From 1996-2017, DUID is unique within panel, but must be combined with PANEL to be unique across panels. Starting in 2018, DUID begins with the 2-digit variable PANEL, making DUID unique across panels. DUID can be combined with PID to uniquely identify each person within the Dwelling Unit. Please see the user note [URL omitted from DDI.] for more information on the relationship between Dwelling Units, families, Reporting Units, and persons.]]></txt>

IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSID, created by concatenating the values of DUID, PID, and PANEL.

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, MEPSID is a variable that uniquely identifies respondents across MEPS panels. It is created by combining PANEL, DUID, and PID. IPUMS MEPS staff create MEPSID for the 1996-2017 samples to provide a single, universal linking key for MEPS persons. Beginning in 2018, AHRQ modified the identifiers DUID and DUPERSID (which combines DUID with PID) on the original MEPS data files to append information about PANEL to the first two columns. This update makes DUPERSID identical to MEPSID in the IPUMS MEPS extract system for 2018-forward.

In earlier versions of IPUMS MEPS, IPUMS MEPS staff created a slightly different version of MEPSID, equivalent to combining DUID, PID, and PANEL. This version has been renamed to MEPSID2 and is only available for 1996-2017.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, PANEL reports the number of the panel of which the person was a member. MEPS began in 1996 with Panel number 1 and the panel number for persons entering the MEPS in each subsequent year increases by 1, so that 1997 had Panels 1 (the panel that entered in 1996, in their second year in 1997) and 2 (the panel newly entering MEPS in 1997), 1998 had Panels 2 and 3, 1999 had Panels 3 and 4, and so on. PANEL can be combined with DUID and PID to uniquely identify individuals across panels. IPUMS MEPS offers the constructed variable MEPSID that is equal to the concatenated values of DUID, PID, and PANEL.

      <txt><![CDATA[PSUPLD is the pooled variance primary sampling unit variable that represents the impact of the sample design clustering on the estimates of variance and standard errors. It is appropriate to use PSUPLD instead of the annual primary sampling unit (PSUANN) if the years included in a pooled analysis include survey year 2001 or earlier. When pooling data from only 2002 and later, use the variable PSUANN, the annual stratum variable for each survey year.

For analysis, researchers need to use PSUPLD in conjunction with STRATAPLD to account for stratification and clustering when computing variance estimates with IPUMS MEPS data. 


PSUPLD should be used when analysts wish to pool together (aka combine) more than one year of MEPS annual data including any years before 2002. In most years, MEPS samples are not completely independent from one another, both because each panel is in the MEPS for two consecutive years and because households are sampled from the same geographic areas in multiple years. However, because MEPS is designed to be nationally representative in every year, multiple sample years can still be pooled. The use of PSUPLD and STRAPLD is necessary to obtain appropriate standard errors by specifying a common variance structure.

This weight should be used for many cross-sectional analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. 

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly when analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire or the Diabetes Care Survey, or when conducting longitudinal analyses with the MEPS data. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the Self-Administered Questionnaire from 2000 forward should use SAQWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT.

Collection of information on SEX in MEPS

Data on the sex of each reporting unit (RU) member was determined during the NHIS interview [URL omitted from DDI.], and was then verified, and, if necessary, corrected during each MEPS interview.

If the respondent was a new RU member or their sex was not ascertained in the NHIS interview, MEPS initially used the first name of the respondent to assign their sex. If the first name gave no clear indication of sex, the reported family relationships were used to assign sex. If the sex of the respondent was still unclear, sex was randomly assigned. 

The NHIS method of ascertaining the sex of the respondent, which primarily informs the MEPS version of SEX, is similar to the MEPS method. First, sex of the respondent was inferred from the individual's first name or family relationships. If the sex of the respondent was unclear, the interviewer was instructed to explicitly ask the person's sex. Beginning in 1998, interviewers were told to "enter your best guess" when the respondent either did not know or refused to answer the direct question that was asked about the person's sex.

      <txt><![CDATA[FAMSIZE reports the number of persons in a family. FAMSIZE is generated by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, rather than based on a direct question to survey respondents. 


A MEPS family may include foster children, as well as unmarried persons living together who consider themselves a family unit (these are not included in the CPS family definition). Single persons who do not live with a relative nor a person identified as a "significant other" are assigned a family size of one.

In most cases, this information was collected via the question, "In what year did you come to the United States to stay?"  If the response to this question was "refused" or "don't know," the interviewer tried to collect the information via an alternatively phrased question: "About how long have you been in the United States?"   

The data included in the public use files for YRSINUS are recodes of the responses to these questions, with each answer in the form of a calendar year converted to a number of years present.  The calendar year format of the initial question would have increased the precision of responses by discouraging rounding; the recoded format (number of years present) is easier for researchers to analyze.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[EDUC reports the highest level of schooling an individual had completed, in terms of completed grades for persons with less than a high school degree, and in terms of degrees attained for high school graduates and those with higher education. EDUC is available for all survey participants age 5 and older at the time of their first MEPS interview. It is an IPUMS MEPS constructed variable. 

See Comparability section for more information on the construction of EDUC.

Education Variables offered through IPUMS MEPS

In addition to EDUC, there are several other educational attainment variables offered through MEPS. Unlike EDUC, these variables are not available for every MEPS year.
EDUCYR: Years of education completed (available 1996-2011 and 2014 forward)
HIDEG: Highest degree completed (available 1996-2011 and 2014 forward) 
EDUYRDG: Years of education and highest degree completed (available 2011-2015)
EDRECODE: Years of education, recode (available 2011-2015)

      <txt><![CDATA[FTOTVAL reports the total income for each person's CPS family.

Beginning in 2007, FAMINC was constructed from the person-level total income variable (INCTOT).

CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

FTOTVAL was derived by constructing person-level total income comprising annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions; business and farm games and losses; unemployment and workers' compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and related programs; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Person-level income excluded tax refunds and capital gains. Person-level income totals were then summed over family members, as defined by CPSFAMID, to yield CPS family-level total income.

Two additional family income variables were created by IPUMS MEPS. FTOTINCCPS is IPUMS MEPS constructed, and offers total family income for CPS families (excludes foster children and unmarried partners).  FTOTINCMEPS is IPUMS MEPS constructed, and offers total family income for MEPS families (includes foster children and unmarried partners). Both FTOTINCCPS and FTOTINCMEPS are constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income)]]></txt>

Please refer to the IPUMS user note on Income Data in MEPS [URL omitted from DDI.] for more information on the collection, editing (including top- and bottom-coding), and imputation of income variables in MEPS, as well as changes to the target population for income data collection over time. Users may also be interested in the data quality flag, QINCWAGE, which reports the editing methods used for INCWAGE.

If respondents needed more information about what types of income to report as wage and salary income, they were provided with the additional guidance: "This includes all income from wages, salary, commissions, and bonuses and is shown in Box 2 of the tax filer's W-2 form. Tips, scholarships, fellowship grants, and dependent care benefits should also be included." INCWAGE may be edited based on round-level employment data for persons who were both working for pay and reported earning zero dollars of income.  

Information on the IPUMS defined-universe for this variable

Users may wish to note that, while IPUMS defines the universe for this variable as all persons, certain persons were explicitly targeted to answer questions about specific income sources. In addition to the target population of persons who were asked specifically about wage income, all persons in the household were eligible to list additional income from "other" sources, which includes income from sources previously asked about in the survey (such as wage income). It is unclear if wage income reported as an "other" income source is counted in wage income or "other" income. Because all persons could technically report wage income via the "other" income questionnaire item, IPUMS staff report the universe for INCWAGE as being "All Persons." Users may also wish to note that in the original public use MEPS data files, no income variables have cases explicitly coded as out of universe; both persons who directly report earning zero dollars of income from a source and persons who are not explicitly asked about that income source have values of zero.

      <labl>Family income as a percentage of the poverty line, continuous</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[POVLEV is a continuous measure of the ratio of total family income (excluding capital gains and tax refunds) to the federal poverty line. MEPS staff constructed POVLEV primarily from data collected in the Income section of the MEPS questionnaire, by dividing CPS family income by the applicable poverty line (based on family size and composition).  

CPS families are defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Unlike the MEPS defined family, CPS family does not include unmarried partners or foster children.

Family income was constructed by constructing person-level total income comprising annual earnings from wages, salaries, bonuses, tips, commissions;  business and farm gains and losses; unemployment and workman's compensation; interest and dividends; alimony, child support, and other private cash transfers; private pensions, IRA withdrawals, social security, and veterans payments; supplemental security income and cash welfare payments from public assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and Aid to Dependent Children; gains or losses from estates, trusts, partnerships, S corporations, rent, and royalties; and a small amount of "other" income. Family income excluded tax refunds and capital gains.  

Person-level income totals were then summed over family members as defined by CPSFAMID to yield the family-level total. Persons missing CPSFAMID were treated as one-person families in constructing POVLEV.

Logical editing or weighted, sequential hot-deck imputation were used to impute income amounts for missing values (both for non-response and for persons in the full-year file who were not in the round where income questions were asked). Round-level data on employment status, hours worked, and wages were used to supplement earnings data collected in the Income Section. 

A categorical variable POVCAT for the ratio of total family income to federal poverty line is also available in all survey years. Two categorical IPUMS MEPS constructed variables are also available. (POVCATCPS) and (POVCATMEPS) offer family income to poverty level ratio data in more detailed categories, for all survey years. POVCAT and POVCPSCAT calculate family income to poverty level ratios for the CPS family (excludes foster children and unmarried partners). POVCATMEPS uses MEPS families (includes foster children and unmarried partners). POVCATCPS and POVCATMEPS are constructed from the public (edited and top-coded) versions of total individual income (summed across MEPS family), and therefore may not match POVCAT.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons eligible for the Access to Care supplement (AC) (ACCESSELIG), USUALPL indicates whether they have a particular doctor's office, clinic, health center, or other place they usually go if they are sick or need advice about their health.

Notes about the Universe

In the course of investigating this variable for integration, IPUMS MEPS staff discovered some non-adherent cases in 1999-2001. In 1999, three individuals are marked as eligible for the Access to Care Supplement, but are not in universe for USUALPL. In 2000, there are nine people who meet those same criteria and in 2001 there are six people. From 2002 forward, all people who are eligible for the AC are also in universe for USUALPL.


The Access to Care Supplement
This variable is part of the Access to Care supplement, a section of the MEPS HC survey fielded to participants in Rounds 2 and 4 of data collection to gain information on barriers family members have faced in obtaining needed health care, the usual source of care for all family members, and characteristics of usual source of care health providers. MEPS administers the AC to all current RU members in Rounds 2 and 4, excluding those who are deceased or institutionalized (ACCESSELIG). This section was redesigned in 2002 (Panel 6 Round 4 and Panel 7 Round 2) to focus more on possible language barriers and other problems faced in obtaining necessary health, dental, or prescription medicine care.

      <labl>Ever told had cancer</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For persons ages 18 and older who were living at the time of the Round 1 interview, CANCEREV identifies respondents who have been diagnosed with cancer. Respondents were asked if they have ever been told "by a doctor or other health professional that (PERSON) had cancer or a malignancy of any kind?"


Beginning in Panel 12, CANCEREV was included as a Priority Condition in the Priority Conditions Enumeration (PE) section. For more information about how the panel design of the MEPS impacts data collection, please see the MEPS Panel Design user note [URL omitted from DDI.]. The PE section was asked in its entirety in Round 1 for all current or institutionalized persons, and in Rounds 2 and 4 only for new reporting unit members. In Rounds 3 and 5, the specific condition questions (except joint pain and chronic bronchitis) were asked only if the person had not reported the condition in a previous round; the joint pain and chronic bronchitis questions were asked in Rounds 3 and 5 for all current or institutionalized persons aged 18 or older, regardless of Round 1, Round 2, and Round 4 responses. However, beginning in 2017, the PE section is no longer asked in Round 5. The conditions included in the PE section are:
High blood pressure, including multiple diagnoses (HYPERTENEV)
Heart disease (including coronary heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and other unspecified heart disease) (CHEARTDIEV)
Stroke (STROKEV)
Emphysema (EMPHYSEMEV)
Chronic Bronchitis
High cholesterol, including the age of diagnosis (CHOLHIGHEV, CHOLHIGHAGE)
Cancer
Diabetes (DIABETICEV)
Joint pain
Arthritis (ARTHGLUPEV)
Asthma (ASTHMAEV)
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD/ADD) (ADDEV)
These conditions were selected because of their relatively high prevalence, and because generally accepted standards for appropriate clinical care have been developed.

Beginning with Panel 12, condition data were collected at the person-by-round level (indicating if the person was ever diagnosed with the condition) and at the condition level. If the person reported having been diagnosed with a condition, the person-by-round variable was set to '1' (Yes) and a condition record for that medical condition was created.

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, EREXPTOT captures the sum of direct payments for care provided during the year for all visits to emergency room medical providers, including out-of-pocket payments and payments by private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and other sources. Payments for over-the-counter drugs and indirect payments not related to specific medical events, such as Medicaid Disproportionate Share and Medicare Direct Medical Education subsidies, are not included in this amount.

Note that hospitals usually include expenses associated with emergency room visits that immediately result in an inpatient stay with the charges and payments for the inpatient stay. Therefore, to avoid the potential for double counting when imputing missing expenses, separately reported facility expenditures for emergency room visits that were identified in the Medical Provider Component (MPC) as directly linked to an inpatient stay were included as part of the inpatient stay only (see HPCHGTOT and HPFCHT). This strategy to avoid double counting resulted in $0 facility expenditures for these emergency room visits (but there still may be associated separately-billing doctor expenses). However, these $0 emergency room visits are still counted as separate visits in the utilization variable ERTOTVIS.

Due to the data collection methodology, it was not possible to determine whether vision items that were reported in Round 3 had been purchased in the first or second year of the longitudinal panel. Therefore, expenses reported in Round 3 were only included in the annual file for a given year if more than half of the person's reference period for the round took place in that year.
