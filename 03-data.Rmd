## Introduction

<!-- TODO: -->

<!-- Rewrite entire webscraping section. Delete everything you don't like. Look closely at the current version of the tutorial. Rewrite this section so that it will be easy to fold the tutorial questions into it at some point in the future. -->

<!-- Start of chapter, mention that all the files we are working on live in this directory, called `file_dir <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/"`. Then, define `file_1 <- paste0(file_dir, "test_1.csv")` or whatever. -->

<!-- The tutorial includes a lot of arguments like na and comment, but that makes the book feel like it's really long once it's actually put into text form with paragraphs and stuff. True! So, what do we include and what do we not? -->

Start by loading the packages which we will need in this chapter.


```{r, message = FALSE}

library(primer.data)
library(lubridate)
library(dbplyr)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)

## Writing and reading files

Getting data into and out of R is a major part of any real world data science project. There are multiple data formats that you use to transport this data, each with their own positives and negatives.

### CSV files

"CSV" stands for **c**omma **s**eparated **v**alue. In other words, csv files are files whose values are separated by commas. Each comma from the csv file corresponds to a column, and the column names are, by default, taken from the first line of the file.

CSV files (and their counterparts) are easily transferable between computers and programming languages and are extremely simple because they're effectively just text files that have a special format. Additionally, they're very easy to parse through small amounts of data because they're easily readable by humans and computers. 
However, due to their simple nature, CSV files are only able to move basic data and only as text values. They also have poor support for special characters like commas, which can make the dataset harder to organize and understand by adding a new column for a few specific entries. This make CSV files good for sharing data between computers and languages, but not efficient for transporting or saving large amounts of data.

#### Reading and writing from a CSV file

Here's an example of a CSV file and what it looks like. Use `read_csv()` from the **readr** package --- which is one of the main packages within the **tidyverse** collection of packages --- to load the data into R. The `file` argument is the file path for the CSV file.

```{r}
# We can access files either by using their URL or their file path.
# In this case, we're using the GitHub URL to access the database.

file_1 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/test_1.csv"
read_csv(file = file_1)
```

<!-- the path argument is deprecated, use file instead -->

Use `write_csv()` to save a tibble to a csv file. `write_csv()` has two main arguments: `x` and `file`. The `x` argument is the data set that you want to save. The `file` argument is the file path to which you want to save the file. The end of the `file` argument is the name that you want to use for the file. 

```{r}
csv_data <- tribble(
  ~ `a`, ~ `b`, ~ `c`,
      1,     2,     3,
      4,     5,     6)

write_csv(x = csv_data, file = "my_csv.csv")
```

When we read the csv file again, the data shows up. This is useful for saving information both to share and for your own projects.

```{r}
read_csv("my_csv.csv")
```

When you want to remove a file from your system, use `file.remove()`.

```{r}
file.remove("my_csv.csv")
```

#### Arguments for CSV files

Sometimes, CSV files will not be what you want. Maybe they have the wrong column names, have information at the top of the file, or have comments interspersed within the file.

Consider the following csv file: `test_2.csv`. Here's what it looks like as a text file:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# I made it so that it doesn't show this line of code This is so it doesn't
# confuse the readers And it lines up with the introduction that I used without
# looking weird We set `file_1` to be the full path to `test_2.csv`'s location
# on the web.

file_2 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/test_2.csv"
  
readLines(file_2)
```

As you can see, there is text at the top of this file. Often times information about how data was collected, or other relevant information, is included at the top of the data file. However, `read_csv()` can't differentiate between this text and the data that we want to read, causing it to fail and output gibberish.

```{r}
# You can also get a csv file by using the URL of the file. This won't work for
# all file types though.

file_2 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/test_2.csv"

read_csv(file_2)
```

We can use the `skip` argument to skip the first 2 text lines and allow `read_csv()` to work.

```{r}
read_csv(file = file_2,
         skip = 2)
```

Now that we've gotten rid of the warnings, let's look at the other message R sends: the column specification message. 

The column specification message is a message that R sends to tell you what data types it is using for the column.

Data types are the types discussed in Chapter 2 Wrangling, such as characters, factors, integers, and dates.
When we use a tibble, each column has to have a specific type of data. In this example, all of the columns have numbers in them. If there are characters in the column, the columns are going to have a character data type.

To get rid of the column specification message, use the `col_types()` argument and specify the data types. You can do this by just copying the column specification message and putting it as the `col_types()` argument.

```{r}
read_csv(file = file_2,
         skip = 2,
         col_types = cols(a = col_double(),
                          b = col_double(),
                          c = col_double()))
```

You can also change the column arguments so that you get the data type that you want.
Take `test_7.csv`.

```{r}
file_3 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/test_7.csv"

read_csv(file_3)
```

Let's try parsing this so that the `student` column is a factor and the `grade` column is an integer.
```{r}
read_csv(file_3,
         col_types = cols(grade = col_integer(),
                          student = col_factor()))
```
By being clever with the columns, we can make our lives easier down the line when we graph the data.

We can also manipulate other arguments for CSV files.

Let's try changing the column names in the `test_3.csv` file.

As you can see below, the file doesn't have any column names, resulting in the first row being considered as a column.

```{r}
file_4 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/test_3.csv"
read_csv(file_4)
```

We can fix this by changing the `col_names` argument.

```{r}
read_csv(file_4, col_names = c("a", "b", "c"))
```

You can also create names automatically by setting `col_names` to FALSE

```{r}
read_csv(file_4, col_names = FALSE)
```

Changing the names of the columns allows for you to call on the columns later when the data is actually a tibble. Setting the column names to something that you can understand makes it much easier to understand your code later on.



Another feature is the `na` argument.
```{r}
file_5 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/test_5.csv"
read_csv(file_5)
```

`test_5.csv` is missing a value, and it uses a `.` as a substitute. This makes the computer think that the period is the actual value of the data point, which is obviously not true (we want numbers instead). By default, `read_csv()` treats white space like ` ` as a missing value, but you can set this argument directly as well.

```{r}
read_csv(file_5,
         na = ".")
```

You can also tell the code to ignore comment lines, which may be common in a csv file that was written by a human and as such has comments in it. `test_6.csv` is a perfect example of this. Here's what it looks like:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
file_6 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/test_6.csv"
readLines(file_6)
```

By setting the `comment` argument, we're able to skip lines that have a certain starting point.
In this case, the comment is the `#` sign, so we just need to include that in.

```{r}
read_csv(file_6, comment = "#")
```

If you ever want to skip certain lines, just use the `comment` argument in order to designate it as something to be skipped. This is best used with cases where the `read_csv()` command will not compile without it.

So far, we've covered how we can organize CSV data, but at it's core we're working with comma separated values. But what happens when we want to read data from something that doesn't use commas to separate the values?

When our tabular data comes in a different format, we can use the `read_delim()` function instead. For example, a different version of `test_6.csv` could exist that has no column names and uses pipes (`|`) as the delimiter instead of commas.

Here's another file named `delim_1`, which uses the `|` to separate the lines instead of a comma like a normal CSV file.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
delim_1 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/delim_1.txt"

readLines(delim_1)
```

With `read_delim()`, we specify the first argument as the path to the file, as done with `read_csv()`. Then we provide values to the `delim` argument to have the code use `|` as the separator instead of the comma.

```{r}
# Because delim_1 uses pipes to separate values, 
# we can just use that as our delim value.
# However, for more complex symbols like tab, 
# we use something different like "\\t"
# This varies for every symbol, but you can 
# find most delim values on the internet.

delim_1 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/delim_1.txt"

read_delim(delim_1, delim = "|")
```

You can often find CSV files on websites like [kaggle](https://kaggle.com) as well as by exporting from an Excel spreadsheet. Keep in mind that data imported off of the internet is often very messy, so try to use some of the functions listed here to clean it up. For a full list of arguments and in-depth documentation about the `read_csv()` function, please visit this [website](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html).

### Excel files

Excel is a spreadsheet program that use tables to analyze, store, or manipulate data. The tables are composed of cells which include text, numbers, or formulas. Excel files have the filename extension .xlsx. They store additional things that you cannot store in a .csv file such as fonts, text formatting, graphics, etc.

In order to write excel files you have to install complex packages, and they are hard to create. Writing excel files is beyond the scope of Primer.

This makes Excel files valuable because they're commonly accepted and usable (Microsoft Excel is a very common program), but they're also hard to use because you can't write new data into them. This makes Excel files more common for data that was originally in Excel, like accounting data or other spreadsheet applications.

Reading Excel files is easy. To do so, we use the `read_excel()` function from the **readxl** package.

```{r}
library(readxl)

# Unfortunately, it is not possible to read Excel files directly from the web.
# So we download the file by hand and then read it in from the current working
# directory. Note that the "proper" way of handling this would be to create a
# temp directory with tempdir(), download the file into that directory, read it,
# and then delete the temp directory. That way, you would not have random
# downloaded files hanging around.

# The mode = "wb" is a necessary addition for Windows users because Windows is
# weird. It's not necessary on MacOS and may cause an error as well.

download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.tutorials/master/inst/www/excel_1.xlsx", 
              destfile = "example_excel.xlsx", mode = "wb")


read_excel(path = "example_excel.xlsx")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Just doing this to clean up the downloaded file so that Git does not ask me
# about it each time I build the book. Maybe we should be transparent and
# include this code above, like we did with download.file(). (Or maybe we should
# hide download.file() as well!) But this seems OK for now.

file.remove("example_excel.xlsx")
```


If the .xlsx file has multiple sheets, you have to use the `sheet` argument to specify the sheet number or name. 
The `read_excel()` function has arguments similar to the `read_csv()` function such as `col_names`, `col_types`, and `na`.

### RDS files

One very important aspect of R is saving objects into  RDS  files, which store a single R object into a file.
These files allow us to save R objects such as plots and tibbles into R and then reload the object that it contains later without re-running the code that made it.
This is especially useful for when you're dealing with bulk data and want to save the plot that comes with it for later.
With a RDS file, you save the entire object, allowing you to do more things with it later without having to go through all of the code.
However, RDS files are limited to R projects only, and they're often incomprehensible both to human eyes and to other programming languages. This makes RDS files ideal for saving objects temporarily in your own project or for sharing objects to other R users.

Take the following R object, a graph of the `iris` data set.

```{r}
iris_p <- iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(title = "Sepal Dimensions of Various Species of Iris",
       x = "Sepal Length",
       y = "Sepal Width")
iris_p
```

When we save to a RDS file, we use the function `write_rds()`. Just like `write_csv()`, this function has two main arguments: `x` and `file`.  The `x` argument is the object that you want to save. The `file` argument is the file path where you want to save the file. The end of the path argument is the name that you want to use for the file.

```{r}
# Technically, it's incorrect to save a ggplot plot as a RDS file because it has
# no real benefit. It still just acts as a plot and restricts the user to only
# using ggplot functions. It's more practical to save the data set itself.
# We're using a graph here to better show how the RDS file is unique from other
# data formats like CSV files.

write_rds(x = iris_p, file = "iris_p.rds")
```

`read_rds()` reads the file back into R. Just like `read_csv()` `read_rds()` has one main argument, which is the path to the file that you are wanting to read into R.

```{r}
read_rds(file = "iris_p.rds")
```

We can then use that R object in more operations, such as adding a trend line.

```{r}
rds_p <- read_rds(file = "iris_p.rds")
rds_p + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess",
              formula = y ~ x,
              se = FALSE)
```

By saving the `iris_p` plot in a RDS file, we eliminate the time needed to calculate and generate that plot again because we can use the saved information. We can then use the object by reading the file back into r and using it like any normal plot, adding new layers and doing new operations.

```{r, include = FALSE}
file.remove("iris_p.rds")
```

There are also .Rdata files which can store multiple objects, but RDS files can accomplish a similar task. This makes it much easier to use RDS files for anything that you want to keep in R.

### JSON

An increasingly common format for sharing data is **J**avaScript **O**bject **N**otation or JSON. Because this format is very general, it is nothing like a spreadsheet. Note that JSON files are often made available via the internet. Several organizations provide a JSON API or a web service that you can connect directly to and from which you can obtain data. 

JSON files are a minimal readable format that structures data, and they're commonly used to transmit data between a server and a web application like a website. For people familiar with the Javascript coding language, you'll likely see the similarities between the JSON file format and the Javascript syntax. This makes JSON files ideal for internet transport, but they don't see much use within a project like RDS files do.

The functions `fromJSON()` and `toJSON()` allow you to convert between R objects and JSON. Both functions come from the **jsonlite** package. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
```

The function `toJSON()` converts a tibble to JSON format. Consider the `example_1` tibble:

```{r}
example_1 <- tibble(name= c("Miguel", "Sofia", "Aya", "Cheng"), 
                    student_id = 1:4, exam_1 = c(85, 94, 87, 90), 
                    exam_2 = c(86, 93, 88, 91))

example_1
```

```{r}
# The pretty argument adds indentation and whitespace when TRUE.

toJSON(example_1, pretty = TRUE) 
```

The function `fromJSON()` converts JSON format to a tibble.

```{r}
json_format_ex <-
'[
  {"Name" : "Mario", "Age" : 32, "Occupation" : "Plumber"}, 
  {"Name" : "Peach", "Age" : 21, "Occupation" : "Princess"},
  {},
  {"Name" : "Bowser", "Occupation" : "Koopa"}
]'

fromJSON(json_format_ex) 
```

Make sure to follow the JSON format exactly when you're writing JSON files, as the format is what makes them special and what allows them to work.

## Databases

Databases are one of the most common methods of storing data, as they are capable of storing large amounts of data while also allowing for multiple people to access and change them at the same time. Think of these like a giant book with a bunch of tables that hold data. These are useful by themselves, but with the advent of computers we are now able to use relational databases.

A relational database is a database that has the tables interact with one another based on common data, allowing you to create custom tables from an existing set of records. For example, a relational database may hold multiple tables that use the same ID to keep track of different information, like one table having an ID and a movie name while another has the ID and the rating. You can then combine those two in your code, creating a table with the ID, name, and rating. This allows the person who made the database to easily put in new data as well as allow you to pull out some data at a time without loading the entire database.

It's common to use and interact with these databases in the real world due to most businesses using relational databases to keep track of their data and to update it at their leisure. It's not uncommon for databases to hold thousands or even millions of rows due to the need to keep track of data.

<!-- Link to writing databases, saving it here for now https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-in-r -->

### Reading data from a SQLite database

SQLite is probably the simplest relational database that one can use in combination with R. SQLite databases are self-contained and usually stored and accessed locally on one computer, instead of on the internet or through the cloud. Data is usually stored in a file with a `.db` extension. Similar to Excel files, these are not plain text files and cannot be read in a plain text editor. 

The first thing you need to do to read data into R from a database is to connect to the database. We do that using `dbConnect()` function from the **DBI** (database interface) package. This does not read in the data, but simply tells R where the database is and opens up a communication channel.

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
download.file(url = "https://github.com/PPBDS/primer/blob/master/03-data/data/can_lang.db?raw=true",
              destfile = "example_db.db", mode = "wb")

con_lang_data <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "example_db.db")
```

Often relational databases have many tables, and their power comes from the useful ways they can be joined. Thus anytime you want to access data from a relational database, you need to know the table names. You can get the names of all the tables in the database using `dbListTables()`.

```{r, con_lang_data}
tables <- dbListTables(con_lang_data)
tables
```

We only get one table name returned,  which tells us that there is only one table in this database. To reference a table in the database to do things like select columns and filter rows, we use the `tbl()` function from the **dbplyr** package. The package **dbplyr** allows us to work with data stored in databases as if they were local data frames, which is useful because we can do a lot with big datasets without actually having to bring these vast amounts of data into your computer! 

```{r}
lang_db <- tbl(con_lang_data, "lang")
lang_db
```

Although it looks like we just got a data frame from the database, we didn't! It's a *reference*, showing us data that is still in the SQLite database (note the first two lines of the output). It does this because databases are often more efficient at selecting, filtering and joining large data sets than R. And typically, the database will not even be stored on your computer, but rather a more powerful machine somewhere on the web. So R is lazy and waits to bring this data into memory until you explicitly tell it. To do so, we use the `collect()` function. 

Here we will filter for only rows in the Aboriginal languages category according to the 2016 Canada Census, and then use `collect()` to finally bring this data into R as a data frame. 

```{r}
aboriginal_lang_db <- filter(lang_db, category == "Aboriginal languages")
aboriginal_lang_db
```

```{r}
aboriginal_lang_data <- collect(aboriginal_lang_db)
aboriginal_lang_data
```

Why bother to use the `collect()` function? The data looks pretty similar in both outputs shown above. And **dbplyr** provides lots of functions similar to `filter()` that you can use to directly feed the database reference (i.e. what `tbl()` gives you) into downstream analysis functions (e.g., `ggplot2` for data visualization and `lm` for linear regression modeling). However, this does not work in every case; look what happens when we try to use `nrow` to count rows in a data frame:

```{r}
nrow(aboriginal_lang_db)
```

or `tail` to preview the last 6 rows of a data frame:

```
tail(aboriginal_lang_db)
```
```
## Error: tail() is not supported by sql sources
```

These functions only work when we use the version that we used collect() on:

```{r}
nrow(aboriginal_lang_data)
```

```{r}
tail(aboriginal_lang_data)
```

In order to delete and stop using an SQLite server, you need to first disconnect the file from the connection be using `dbDisconnect()` and passing in the connection object as an argument. You can then safely delete the database file from your computer by using `file.remove()`.

```{r, results = "hide"}
dbDisconnect(con_lang_data)
file.remove("example_db.db")
```

Additionally, some operations will not work to extract columns or single values from the reference given by the `tbl` function. Thus, once you have finished your data wrangling of the `tbl()` database reference object, it is advisable to bring it into your local machine's memory using `collect()` as a data frame. 

> Warning: Usually, databases are very big! Reading the object into your local machine may give an error or take a lot of time to run so be careful if you plan to do this! 

### Interacting with SQLite databases

Now that we've figured out how to get data from a database, let's look at how to wrangle data within that database.

Because databases normally contain large amounts of data, it's advisable to do your wrangling before you use `collect()` to transform the database table into a tibble. This stops you from pulling large amounts of data onto your computer and just ignoring it.

So let's try pulling in a database and see how we can manipulate it.

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
# Again, use mode = "wb" if you're using a Windows operating system.
download.file(url = "https://github.com/PPBDS/primer/blob/master/03-data/data/chinook.db?raw=true",
             dest = "chinook.db", mode = "wb")

con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "chinook.db")
```

First off, look at what data this database holds.

```{r}
dbListTables(con)
```
There are 13 tables in this database. Let's access the first couple of tables, just so that we can get a good look at them and see how they're structured..

```{r}
albums <- tbl(con, "albums")
albums
artists <- tbl(con, "artists")
artists
```
 
As you can see, each table has a common column: the `ArtistId` column. However, they all have different information linked to that ID, such as "albums" having the albums that artist produced and "artists" having the name of that artist.

Here is the [full relationship diagram](http://schemaspy.org/sample/diagrams/summary/relationships.real.large.png) of the database that we're using.

Let's go over some of the operations that you can do on a SQLite database.

#### Using dbplyr

We've already seen how you can use the **dbpylr** package to get a table from a database, but let's look at how you can also use it to do operations on databases as well.

The **dbpylr** package allows you to use many of the same functions from the **tidyverse** like `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()` without any issues, making it the easiest to do operations with.

Here's an example of using the **dbpylr** package to get the number of albums each artist has created.

```{r} 
# You can keep a column during the summarize() if you just put the name equal to itself.
# This code is deliberately long in order to show the common functions that we use.
band_albums <- tbl(con, "albums") %>%
                 inner_join(tbl(con, "artists"), by = "ArtistId") %>%
                 select("AlbumId", "ArtistId", "Title", "Name") %>%
                 group_by(ArtistId) %>%
                 summarize(Name = Name, num_albums = n()) %>%
                 mutate(artist_name = Name) %>%
                 mutate(artist_id = ArtistId) %>%
                 filter(num_albums > 3) %>%
                 arrange(desc(num_albums)) %>%
                 select(artist_id, artist_name, num_albums)
band_albums
```

These are the functions that we're already familiar with using, and they work just as well on database tables as well.

However, there are cases where you will have to use SQL code to accomplish certain tasks.

#### Using SQL code


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="DROP TABLE is a particularly infamous SQL command."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png")
```

First off, let's try to understand what SQLite and SQL really is.

SQL, or **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage, is a coding language that works to build the relational databases that we've been using so far. SQLite is a special type of database that you can download onto your computer that uses SQL as its basic structure and basic language. Essentially, SQLite uses SQL code to do the things that it does.

While you shouldn't need to write SQL code in this course, it's very common to read from an SQL database in order to access data so that you can graph it.

SQL runs through something known as a **query**, a line of code that pulls in information from the database. This is effectively asking the database for a specific set of data. This is what's known as a `SELECT` command, which "selects" data from the database and brings it into your computer for your use.

```{sql, connection = con}
-- This code is written in SQL syntax, so it won't work if you just put it into R. 
-- We'll be going over how to write SQL in R later in this section.
SELECT AlbumId, Title, ArtistId FROM albums
```

You can then modify these queries to do operations like joins.
```{sql, connection = con}
-- This does the same thing as the inner join from Chapter 2 Wrangling
-- Here we're joining the albums and the artists table by the ArtistId column
SELECT ArtistId, Name, Title FROM (
  SELECT Title, albums.ArtistId AS "ArtistId", "Name"
  FROM albums
  INNER JOIN artists
  ON albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId

>If you're interested in what SQL statements mean and how to write SQL code, visit this [tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/).

In fact, the `dbplyr` commands actually use SQL code to create their effect.
You can run `show_query()` to see the SQL code, or the *query* that `dbplyr` produces.

```{r}
show_query(band_albums)
```

However, you can't do everything from SQL through the `dbplyr` package. For example, you can't use the `slice()` command.

```
slice(band_albums, 1:10)
```
```
## Error: slice() is not supported on database backends
```

This is possible in an SQL database. There are a couple of ways to run SQL code in R, but the easiest way is by using the `dbGetQuery()` function from the **DBI** library.

<!-- AG: This is my first time doing SQL code and I'm more experienced with Java/Python, so I formatted it like how Java and Python are formatted with the parentheses acting as brackets instead. This may be heresy in the SQL world, so please tell me if I have to fix it. -->

```{r}
# This code is just copy-pasted from the earlier dbplyr code so you can best understand it.
# It's also organized for readability, with the parentheses having their own lines.
# This isn't how SQL code is formatted normally, but it's intended for readability.
# This is probably more understandable for people who have Java or Python experience

dbGetQuery(con, "
  SELECT `artist_id`, `artist_name`, `num_albums` FROM (
    SELECT `ArtistId`, `Name`, `num_albums`, `artist_name`, `ArtistId` AS `artist_id` FROM (
      SELECT `ArtistId`, `Name`, `num_albums`, `Name` AS `artist_name` FROM (
        SELECT `ArtistId`, `Name`, COUNT(*) AS `num_albums` FROM (
          SELECT `AlbumId`, `ArtistId`, `Title`, `Name` FROM (
            SELECT `AlbumId`, `Title`, `LHS`.`ArtistId` AS `ArtistId`, `Name` FROM `albums` AS `LHS`
            INNER JOIN `artists` AS `RHS` ON (`LHS`.`ArtistId` = `RHS`.`ArtistId`)
          )
        )
        GROUP BY `ArtistId`
      )
    )
  )
  WHERE (`num_albums` > 3.0)
  ORDER BY `num_albums` DESC
")
```

This method allows you to only use R code within your project, making it easier.

You can also use SQL code directly in your project by changing the header in an Rmarkdown file. When you code in an Rmarkdown file, you create chunks that look like this:
```
## ```{r}
##
## ```
```

You can code in SQL by changing the chunk to look like this:

```
## ```{sql, connection = con, output.var = "your_variable_name"}
## 
## ```
```

This allows you to write SQL code in genuine SQL syntax and save the output to a variable.
```
## ```{sql, connection = con, output.var = "your_variable_name"}
## SELECT * FROM albums
## ```
```

```{sql, connection = con, output.var = "your_variable_name", echo = FALSE}
-- SQL uses a semicolon to show the end of the statements
-- However, you don't need to include that for the dbGetQuery() statemetn
SELECT * FROM albums;
```

You can then use that variable in your R code.
```{r}
head(your_variable_name)
```

Coding in SQL allows you to do the things that the **dbplyr** package doesn't, such as only using certain rows. If you add `LIMIT 10;` at the end of the query (the first `SELECT` statement), you can limit the query to only the first 10 rows.

```{sql, connection = con, output.var = "band_albums_sql"}
-- We're writing this code using the sql code chunk method. 
-- This is because it allows you to see what's highlighted and what's not.
-- SQL code is also inconvenient because you can't just add a new line,
-- Instead, you need to treat all of these lines of code as a single statement
-- Then add in the command where you think that it would fit.
SELECT `artist_id`, `artist_name`, `num_albums` FROM (
  SELECT `ArtistId`, `Name`, `num_albums`, `artist_name`, `ArtistId` AS `artist_id` FROM (
    SELECT `ArtistId`, `Name`, `num_albums`, `Name` AS `artist_name` FROM (
      SELECT `ArtistId`, `Name`, COUNT(*) AS `num_albums` FROM (
        SELECT `AlbumId`, `ArtistId`, `Title`, `Name` FROM (
          SELECT `AlbumId`, `Title`, `LHS`.`ArtistId` AS `ArtistId`, `Name` FROM `albums` AS `LHS`
          INNER JOIN `artists` AS `RHS` ON (`LHS`.`ArtistId` = `RHS`.`ArtistId`)
        )
      )
      GROUP BY `ArtistId`
    )
  )
)
WHERE (`num_albums` > 3.0)
ORDER BY `num_albums` DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
```{r}
# You can't see this, but output.var = "band_albums_sql" in the chunk above this.
# So we're outputting our data into band_albums_sql
band_albums_sql
```

SQL is more versatile than `dbplyr`, but it's also a lot more confusing because it's not as straightforward. This creates one golden rule:

> **Use dbplyr functions for data analysis and SQL code for accessing data**

This is because SQL code is weird and hard to understand, but it allows you to easily pull in data. SQL is a coding language designed for you to query or ask databases for data. Meanwhile, `dbplyr` is meant for analyzing that data and modifying it.

```{r, include = FALSE}
dbDisconnect(con)
file.remove("chinook.db")
```

Now, we worked with an SQLite database within this tutorial due to its simplicity. However, there are other databases that can be accessed in different ways. For example, a PostgresSQL server is located on the internet and allows you to pull data from the internet instead of downloading it into your computer. You can learn about some of the types of SQL databases and their differences [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems).

**Why should we bother with databases at all?**

Opening a database stored in a `.db` file involved a lot more effort than just opening a `.csv`, `.tsv`, or any of the other plain text or Excel formats. It was a bit of a pain to use a database in that setting since we had to use `dbplyr` to translate `tidyverse`-like commands (`filter`, `select`, `head`, etc.) into SQL commands that the database understands. Not all `tidyverse` commands can currently be translated with SQLite databases, like we showed with `slice()`. So you might be wondering, why should we use databases at all? 

Databases are beneficial in a large-scale setting:

- they enable storing large data sets across multiple computers with automatic redundancy and backups
- they allow multiple users to access them simultaneously and remotely without conflicts and errors
- they provide mechanisms for ensuring data integrity and validating input
- they provide security to keep data safe
For example, [there are billions of Google searches conducted daily](https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/). 

This makes databases extremely useful for a business where they'll have employees doing thousands or millions of operations daily. This makes knowing what SQL databases are extremely vital from both a data science and a general usage perspective.

## Webscraping

In the first part of this chapter, we learned how to read in data from plain text files that are usually "rectangular" in shape using the **tidyverse** `read_*` functions. Sadly, not all data comes in this simple format, but we can happily use many other tools to read in more messy/wild data formats. The formal name for gathering non-rectangular data from the web and transforming it into a more useful format for data analysis is **web scraping**.

We can do web scraping through r by using the **`rvest`** library, which is a library that allows us to look at HTML and CSS selectors, then pick them apart to get the data we want. Let's look at what this means.

### HTML and CSS selectors

Before we jump into scraping, let's learn a little bit about what the "source code" of a website looks like. 

#### Structure of websites
Websites are coded in a language called **HTML**, or **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. This is the code that puts all of the information on the website, such as the numbers and text. These are the files created when we "knit" our .Rmd files and it's what makes them put information on the screen. When we're webscraping, we can look at the information on the website by looking at the HTML code.

HTML uses many nested "tags" to organize the structure. For example, an html file like this:
```{.html}
<html>
<p>
Hello World
</p>
</html>
```

looks like this in the result:

<br>
<html>
<p  style="background-color:lightgray">
Hello World
</p>
</html>
<br>

#### Application
Now let's look at this in a real-world context. Say we are interested in knowing the average rental price (per square footage) of the most recently available one-bedroom apartments in Vancouver from https://vancouver.craigslist.org. When we visit the Vancouver Craigslist website and search for one-bedroom apartments, this is what we are shown:

![](03-data/images/craigslist_human.png)

From that page, it's pretty easy for our human eyes to find the apartment price and square footage. But how can we do this programmatically, so we don't have to copy and paste all these numbers? Well, we have to deal with the webpage source code, which we show a snippet of below (and link to the [entire source code here](img/website_source.txt)):

```
        <span class="result-meta">
                <span class="result-price">$800</span>

                <span class="housing">

```

This is not easy for our human eyeballs to read! However, it is easy for us to use programmatic tools to extract the data we need by specifying which HTML tags (things inside `<` and `>` in the code above). For example, if we look in the code above and search for lines with a price, we can also look at the tags that are near that price and see if there's a common "word" we can use that is near the price but doesn't exist on other lines that have the information we are not interested in:

```
<span class="result-price">$800</span>
```

and 

```
<span class="result-price">$2285</span>
```

What we can see is there is a special "word" here, "result-price", which appears only on the lines with prices and not on the other lines (that have information we are not interested in). This special word and the context in which is is used (learned from the other words inside the HTML tag) can be combined to create something called a **CSS selector**. The CSS selector can then be used by R's rvest package to select the information we want (here price) from the website source code.

Many websites are quite large and complex, which means the website source code is large as well. And as you saw above, it is not easy to read and pick out the special words we want with our human eyeballs. So to make this easier, we will use the *SelectorGadget* tool. It is an open source tool that simplifies generating and finding CSS selectors. We recommend you use the Chrome web browser to use this tool, and install the [selector gadget tool from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb). Here is a short video on how to install and use the SelectorGadget tool to get a CSS selector for use in web scraping:

<iframe width="840" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdIWI6K64zo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

From installing and using the selectorgadget as shown in the video above, we get the two CSS selectors `.housing` and `.result-price` that we can use to scrape information about the square footage and the rental price, respectively. The selector gadget returns them to us as a comma separated list (here `.housing , .result-price`), which is exactly the format we need to provide to R if we are using more than one CSS selector.

### Are you allowed to scrape that website?

**BEFORE** scraping data from the web, you should always check whether or not you are **ALLOWED** to scrape it! There are two documents that are important for this: the robots.txt file and reading the website's Terms of Service document. The website's Terms of Service document is probably the more important of the two, and so you should look there first. What happens when we look at Craigslist's Terms of Service document? Well we read this:

*"You agree not to copy/collect CL content via robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, or any automated or manual equivalent (e.g., by hand)."*

source: https://www.craigslist.org/about/terms.of.use


> Want to learn more about the legalities of web scraping and crawling? Read this interesting blog post titled ["Web Scraping and Crawling Are Perfectly Legal, Right?" by Benoit Bernard](https://benbernardblog.com/web-scraping-and-crawling-are-perfectly-legal-right/) (this is optional, not required reading).

So what to do now? Well, we shouldn't scrape Craigslist! Let's instead scrape some data on the population of Canadian cities from Wikipedia (who's [Terms of Service document](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en) does not explicitlty say do not scrape). In this video below we demonstrate using the selectorgadget tool to get CSS Selectors from [Wikipedia's Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) page to scrape a table that contains city names and their populations from the 2016 Canadian Census: 

<iframe width="840" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9HKbdhqYzk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### Using `rvest`

Now that we have our CSS selectors we can use the **rvest** R package to scrape our desired data from the website. First we start by loading the **rvest** package:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(rvest)
```

Next, we tell R what page we want to scrape by providing the webpage's URL in quotations to the function `read_html`:

```{r}
page <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada")
```

Then we send the page object to the `html_nodes()` function. We also provide that function with the CSS selectors we obtained from the selectorgadget tool. These should be surrounded by quotations. The `html_nodes` function select nodes from the HTML document using CSS selectors. Nodes are the HTML tag pairs as well as the content between the tags. For our CSS selector `td:nth-child(5)` and example node that would be selected would be: `<td style="text-align:left;background:#f0f0f0;"><a href="/wiki/London,_Ontario" title="London, Ontario">London</a></td>`

We will use `head()` here to limit the print output of these vectors to 6 lines.

```{r}
population_nodes <- html_nodes(page, "td:nth-child(5) , td:nth-child(7) , .infobox:nth-child(122) td:nth-child(1) , .infobox td:nth-child(3)")

head(population_nodes)
```

Next we extract the meaningful data from the HTML nodes using the `html_text()` function. For our example, this functions only required argument is the an html_nodes object, which we named `rent_nodes`. In the case of this example node: `<td style="text-align:left;background:#f0f0f0;"><a href="/wiki/London,_Ontario" title="London, Ontario">London</a></td>`, the `html_text` function would return `London`.

```{r}
population_text <- html_text(population_nodes)

head(population_text)
```

Are we done? Not quite... If you look at the data closely you see that the data is not in an optimal format for data analysis. Both the city names and population are encoded as characters in a single vector instead of being in a data frame with one character column for city and one numeric column for population (think of how you would organize the data in a spreadsheet). Additionally, the populations contain commas (not useful for programmatically dealing with numbers), and some even contain a line break character at the end (`\n`).

## Working with APIs

<!-- source used here: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/reading-web-based-data.html -->

"API" stands for Application Program Interface. They allow us to access open data from government agencies, companies, and other organizations. API provides the rules for software applications to interact with one another. Open data APIs provide the rules you need to know to write R code to request and pull data from the organization’s web server into R. Usually, some of the computational burden of querying and subsetting the data is taken on by the source’s server, to create the subset of requested data to pass to your computer. In practice, this means you can often pull the subset of data you want from a very large available dataset without having to download the full dataset and load it locally into your R session.

As an overview, the basic steps for accessing and using data from a web API when working in R are:

* Figure out the API rules for HTTP requests
* Write R code to create a request in the proper format
* Send the request using GET or POST HTTP methods
* Once you get back data from the request, parse it into an easier-to-use format if necessary

To get the data from an API, you should first read the organization’s API documentation. An organization will post details on what data is available through their API(s), as well as how to set up HTTP requests to get that data. To request the data through the API, you will typically need to send the organization’s web server an HTTP request using a GET or POST method. The API documentation details will typically show an example GET or POST request for the API, including the base URL to use and the possible query parameters that can be used to customize the dataset request.

Here is an example:

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has an API for pulling the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). In their API documentation, they specify that the base URL for the API request should be **https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod** and that you can include parameters to specify the date of the daily picture you want, whether to pull a high-resolution version of the picture, and a NOAA API key you have requested from NOAA.

Many organizations will require you to get an *API key* and use this key in each of your API requests. This key allows the organization to control API access, including enforcing rate limits per user. API rate limits restrict how often you can request data (such as an hourly limit of 1,000 requests per user for NASA APIs).

API keys should be kept private, so if you are writing code that includes an API key, be very careful not to include the actual key in any code that is public (even any code in public GitHub repositories). To ensure privacy, save the value of your key in a file named .Renviron in your home directory. This file should be a plain text file and must end in a blank line. Once you’ve saved your API key to a global variable in that file (e.g., with a line added to the .Renviron file like NOAA_API_KEY = "abdafjsiopnab038"), you can assign the key value to an R object in an R session using the Sys.getenv function (e.g., noaa_api_key <- Sys.getenv("NOAA_API_KEY")), and then use the object `noaa_api_key` anywhere you would otherwise have used the character string with your API key.

To find more R packages for accessing and exploring open data, check out the [Open Data CRAN task view](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata). You can also browse through the [ROpenSci packages](https://ropensci.org/packages/), all of which have GitHub repositories where you can further explore how each package works! ROpenSci is an organization with the mission to create open software tools for science. If you create your own package to access data relevant to scientific research through an API, consider submitting it for peer-review through ROpenSci.

The **riem** package, developed by Maelle Salmon and an ROpenSci package, is an excellent and straightforward example of how you can use R to pull open data through a web API. This package allows you to pull weather data from airports around the world directly from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. To show you how to pull data into R through an API, in this section we will walk you through code in the **riem** package or code based closely on code in the package.

To get a certain set of weather data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, you can send an HTTP request specifying a base URL, **https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/request/asos.py/**, as well as some parameters describing the subset of dataset you want (e.g., date ranges, weather variables, output format). Once you know the rules for the names and possible values of these parameters (more on that below), you can submit an HTTP GET request using the function` GET()` from the **httr** package.

When you are making an HTTP request using the `GET()` or `POST()` functions from the **httr** package, you can include the key-value pairs for any query parameters as a list object in the `query` argument of the function. For example, suppose you want to get wind speed in miles per hour (data = "sped") for Denver, CO, (station = "DEN") for the month of June 2016 (year1 = "2016", month1 = "6", etc.) in Denver’s local time zone (tz = "America/Denver") and in a comma-separated file (format = "comma"). To get this weather dataset, you can run:



```{r, message = FALSE}
library(httr)
```


```{r}
library(httr)
meso_url <- "https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/request/asos.py/"
denver <- GET(url = meso_url,
                    query = list(station = "DEN",
                                 data = "sped",
                                 year1 = "2016",
                                 month1 = "6",
                                 day1 = "1",
                                 year2 = "2016",
                                 month2 = "6",
                                 day2 = "30",
                                 tz = "America/Denver",
                                 format = "comma")) %>%
  content() %>% 
  read_csv(skip = 5, na = "M")

# There are 9,106 rows of data to look at! Let's just look at subset for our
# purposes.

denver %>% 
  slice(1:3)

```

The `content()` call extracts the content from the response to the HTTP request sent by the `GET()` function. The Iowa Environmental Mesonet API offers the option to return the requested data in a comma-separated file (format = "comma" in the GET request), so here content and `read_csv()` are used to extract and read in that csv file. Usually, data will be returned in a JSON format instead.

The only tricky part of this process is figuring out the available parameter names (e.g., station) and possible values for each (e.g., "DEN" for Denver). Currently, the details you can send in an HTTP request through Iowa Environmental Mesonet’s API include:

* A four-character weather station identifier (`station`)
* The weather variables (e.g., temperature, wind speed) to include (`data`)
* Starting and ending dates describing the range for which you’d like to pull data (`year1`, `month1`, `day1`, `year2`, `month2`, `day2`)
* The time zone to use for date-times for the weather observations (`tz`)
* Different formatting options (e.g., delimiter to use in the resulting data file [`format`], whether to include longitude and latitude)

Typically, these parameter names and possible values are explained in the API documentation. In some cases, however, the documentation will be limited. In that case, you may be able to figure out possible values, especially if the API specifies a GET rather than POST method, by playing around with the website’s point-and-click interface and then looking at the url for the resulting data pages. For example, if you look at the [Iowa Environmental Mesonet’s page](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml?network=IN__ASOS) for accessing this data, you’ll notice that the point-and-click web interface allows you the options in the list above, and if you click through to access a dataset using this interface, the web address of the data page includes these parameter names and values.

The **riem** package implements all these ideas in three very clean and straightforward functions. You can explore the code behind this package and see how these ideas can be incorporated into a small R package, in the /R directory of the [package’s GitHub page](https://github.com/ropensci/riem).

R packages already exist for many open data APIs. If an R package already exists for an API, you can use functions from that package directly, rather than writing your own code using the API protocols and httr functions.

If an R package doesn’t exist for an open API and you’d like to write your own package, find out more about writing API packages with [this vignette for the httr package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html). This document includes advice on error handling within R code that accesses data through an open API.

Information for this section on API's was taken from *Mastering Software Development in R* textbook, authored by Roger D. Peng, Sean Kross, and Brooke Anderson.
