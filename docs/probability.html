<blockquote>
<p>The usual touchstone of whether what someone asserts is mere persuasion or at least a subjective conviction, i.e., firm belief, is betting. Often someone pronounces his propositions with such confident and inflexible defiance that he seems to have entirely laid aside all concern for error. A bet disconcerts him. Sometimes he reveals that he is persuaded enough for one ducat but not for ten. For he would happily bet one, but at ten he suddenly becomes aware of what he had not previously noticed, namely that it is quite possible that he has erred. -— Immanuel Kant, <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em></p>

<p>The central tension, and opportunity, in data science is the interplay between the <em>data</em> and the <em>science</em>, between our empirical observations and the models which we use to understand them. Probability is the language we use to explore that interplay; it connects models to data, and data to models.</p>

FIGURE 5.1: Dice and Probability.
</p>
</div>
<p>What does it mean that Trump has a <em>30% chance</em> of winning re-election this fall? That there is a <em>90% probability</em> of rain today? That the dice at the casino is <em>unfair</em>? If I roll that dice 10 times and five of those times I get a three, how likely is it that the dice is <em>unfair</em>?</p>
<p>Probability is about quantifying uncertainty. We can think of probability as a proportion. The probability of an event occurring is a number from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the event is 100% certain.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the simplest events: coin flips and dice rolls. If the dice and
the coins are fair, we can operate under the assumption that all outcomes are
equally likely.</p>
<p>This allows us to make the following statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability of rolling a 1 or 2 is 2/6, or 1/3.</li>
<li>The probability of rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 is 1.<br>
</li>
<li>The probability of flipping a coin and getting tails is 1/2.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this course, a <em>probability distribution</em> is a mathematical object that covers a set of outcomes, where each distinct outcome has a chance of occurring between 0 and 1 inclusive. The set of possible outcomes — heads or tails for the coin, 1 through 6 for the dice — can be either discrete or continuous. This set of outcomes is the <em>domain</em> of the probability distribution. There are three types of probability distributions: mathematical, empirical, and posterior. Let’s walk through some examples to better understand each type of probability distribution.</p>
<p>Before we continue, we should be familiar with the notation used in this chapter. Whenever we are talking about a specific probability (represented by a single value), we will use <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with a <em>subscript</em>. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span> = 0.5 denotes the probability of getting heads on a coin toss when the coin is fair. <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span> denotes the probability of getting tails on the coin toss. However, when we are referring to the entire probability distribution over a set of outcomes, we will use <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with <em>parentheses</em>. For example, the probability distribution of a coin toss is <span class="math inline">\(p(coin)\)</span>. That said, <span class="math inline">\(p(coin)\)</span> is composed of all the two specific probabilities mapped from the domain.</p>
<div id="flipping-a-coin" class="section level3" number="5.1.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Flipping a coin<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#flipping-a-coin"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A <em>mathematical distribution</em> is based on mathematical formulas. Assuming that the dice is perfectly fair, we should get heads as many times as we get tails.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-369-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>An <em>empirical distribution</em> is based on data. You can think of this as the probability distribution created by running a simulation. In theory, if we increase the number of coins we flip in our simulation, the empirical distribution will look more and more similar to the mathematical distribution. The probability distribution is the Platonic form. The empirical distribution will often look like the mathematical probability distribution, but it will rarely be exactly the same.</p>
<p>In this simulation, there are 49 heads and 51 tails. The outcome will vary every time we run the simulation, but the proportion of heads to tails should not be too different if this coin is fair.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-370-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>An <em>posterior distribution</em> is based on beliefs and expectations. It displays your belief about things you can’t see right now. You may have posterior distributions for events in the past, present, or future.</p>
<p>In the case of the coin toss, the posterior distribution changes depending on your beliefs. For instance, let’s say your friend brought a coin to school and asked to bet you. If the result is heads, you have to pay them $5.</p>
<p>This makes you suspicious; your posterior distribution would reflect this. You might believe that <span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span> is 0.95 while <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span> is 0.05.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Rolling two dice<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rolling-two-dice"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Our <em>mathematical distribution</em> tells us that, with a fair dice, the probability of getting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are equal: there is a 1/6 chance of each. When we roll two dice at the same time and sum the values, the numbers closest to the middle (ex. 6, 7, 8) are more common sums than numbers at the very edge (ex. 2, 12) because there are more combinations of numbers that add up to the middle values.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-372-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>We get an <em>empirical distribution</em> by running a simulation and rolling two dice a hundred times. The result is not identical to the mathematical distribution because of the inherent randomness of the real world. We can observe that the <span class="math inline">\(p_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_12\)</span>, which are displayed on the left and right most ends of the distribution, are far lower than the <span class="math inline">\(p_6\)</span>, for example.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-373-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>The <em>posterior distribution</em> for rolling one dice a hundred depends on your expectations. If you take the dice from your Monopoly set, you have reason to believe that the assumptions underlying the mathematical distribution are true. However, if you walk into a crooked casino and a host asks you to play craps, you might be suspicious. In craps, a come-out roll of 7 and 11 is a “natural” and the you win. You might expect those numbers to occur less often than they would with fair dice. Meanwhile, a come-out roll of 2, 3 is bad for someone betting what’s known as the “Pass line.” You might also expect values like 2 and 3 to occur more frequently. Your posterior distribution might look like this:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-374-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Someone less suspcious of the casina would have a posterior distribution which looks more like the mathematical distribution.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.1.3</span> Presidential elections<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#presidential-elections"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Now we let’s say we are building probability distributions for political events, like a presidential election. We want to know the probability that Democratic candidate wins x electoral votes, where x represents the range of possible outcomes from 0 to 538.</p>
<p>It would be incredibly naive to create the following <em>mathematical distribution</em>. We create a distribution by running a simulation 10,000 times, where the chances of the Democratic candidate winning any given electoral college vote is 0.5.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-375-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>We know that campaign platforms, donations, charisma, and many other factors will contribute to a candidate’s likeability. Elections are more complicated than coin tosses.</p>
<p>The <em>empirical distribution</em> in this case could involve looking into past elections in the United States and counting the number of electoral votes that the Democrats won in each. For the empirical distribution, we create a tibble with electoral vote results from past elections. Looking at elections since 1964, we can observe that the number of electoral votes that the Democrats received in each one is different. Given that we only have 14 entries, it is difficult to draw conclusions or make predictions based off of this empirical distribution.</p>
<p>However, this model is enough to suggest that the assumptions of the mathematical probability distribution above do not work for electoral votes. The model assumes that the Democrats have a 50% chance of receiving each of the 538 votes. Just looking at the mathematical probability distribution, we can observe that receiving 13 or 17 or 486 votes out of 538 would be extreme and almost impossible under this mathematical model. However, our empirical distribution tells us that those were real election results.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-376-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>The <em>posterior distribution</em> in the election case is something data scientists devote a lot of time to. The analysts develop algorithms that consider their expectations for each outcome. Consider this generated using data from <em>FiveThirtyEight</em>.</p>
<pre><code>## 
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## cols(
##   cycle = col_double(),
##   branch = col_character(),
##   model = col_character(),

##   candidate_inc = col_character(),
##   candidate_chal = col_character(),

##   simulations = col_double()
## )</code></pre>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-377-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Here is a posterior from the FiveThirtyEight website from August 13, 2020. This was created using the same data as the above distribution, but simply displayed differently. For each electoral result, the height of the bar represents the probability that a given event will occur. However, there is no numbered y-axis telling us what the specific probability of each outcome is.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="05-probability/images/fivethirtyeight.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Here is the posterior from <em>The Economist</em>, also from August 13, 2020. This looks confusing at first because the data analysts have chosen to merge the axes for Republican and Democratic electoral votes. We can tell that the Economist is more optimistic about Biden’s odds in the election compared to Trump’s, relative to <em>FiveThirtyEight</em>.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="05-probability/images/economist_aug13.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>These two models, built by smart people using the similar data sources, have reached fairly different conclusions. Data science is difficult! There is not one “right” answer. Real life is not a problem set.</p>

<p>A probability distribution is not always easy to work with. It is a complex object. And, in many contexts, we don’t really care about all that complexity. So, instead of providing the full probability distribution, we often just use a summary measure, a number or two or three which captures the aspect of the entire distribution which is relevant to the matter at hand. Let’s explore these issues using the 538 posterior probability distribution, as of August 13, 2020, for the number of electoral votes which will be won by Joe Biden. Here is a tibble with 1,000,000 draws from that distribution:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb546"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">draws</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,000,000 x 2
##       ID electoral_votes
##    &lt;int&gt;           &lt;int&gt;
##  1     1             491
##  2     2             150
##  3     3             369

## 10    10             155
## # … with 999,990 more rows</code></pre>
<p>A distribution and a sample of draws from that distribution are different things. But, if you squint, they are sort of the same thing, at least for our purposes. For example, if you want to know the mean of the distribution, then the mean of the draws will be a fairly good estimate, especially if the number of draws is large enough.</p>
<p>The second way to represent a probability distribution in the computer is as a vector of draws. Recall from Chapter <a href="wrangling.html#wrangling">2</a> how we can draw randomly from specified probability distributions as so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb548"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">rnorm</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">10</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##  [1] -1.090  1.324  1.336  0.039 -1.233  0.794  0.448 -1.081 -0.025 -0.663</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb550"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Uniform.html">runif</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">10</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##  [1] 0.45 0.04 0.34 0.89 0.38 0.88 0.52 0.91 0.81 0.61</code></pre>
<p>These elements of these vectors are all “draws” from the specified probability distributions. In most appplied situations, our tools will produce draws rather than summary objects. Fortunately, a vector of draws is very easy to work with:</p>

<p>Remember that probability distributions are mathematical objects that cover a set of outcomes, where each outcome in the domain is mapped to a probability value between 0 and 1 inclusive and the sum of all mappings is 1. Sometimes, you may see distributions similar to probability distributions, only the y-axis displays raw counts instead of proportions. Unnormalized distributions are not probability distributions, but it is easy to convert between the two. You simply divide all the outcome counts on the y-axis by the sum of all outcome counts to “normalize” and unnormalized distribution. Unnormalized distributions are often an intermediary step; it is often handy to work with counts until the very end.</p>
<p>For instance, we can generate the following unnormalized distribution for the sum of rolling two dice (empirical distribution from running this simulation 100 times). You may notice that the shape of the distribution is the same as the empirical probability distribution we generated earlier, only the y-axis is labeled differently.</p>

<!-- DK: Should be p(A). Discuss p(A, B) -->
<p>Now we understand that <span class="math inline">\(p_A\)</span> can represent the probability distribution of outcomes for event A. Let’s talk about joint distributions, which can be represented by <span class="math inline">\(p_{A, B}\)</span>. Joint distributions are also mathematical objects that cover a set of outcomes, where each distinct outcome has a chance of occurring between 0 and 1 and the sum of all chances equals to 1. The key to a joint distribution is it measures the chance that both events A and B will occur simultaneously.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you are rolling two six-sided dice simultaneously. One is weighted so that there is a 50% chance of rolling a 6 and a 10% chance of each of the other values. The other is weighted so there is a 50% chance of rolling a 5 and a 10% chance of rolling each of the other values. Let’s roll both dice 1000 times. In previous examples involving two dice, we cared about the sum of results and not the outcomes of the first versus the second rolls of each simulation. With a joint distributions, the order matters so instead of 11 possible outcomes on the x-axis of our distribution graph (ranging from 2 to 12), we have 36. Furthermore, a 2D probability distribution is not sufficient to represent all of the variables involved, so the joint distribution for this example is displayed using a 3D plot.</p>

<p>So far, you have learned how to calculate <span class="math inline">\(p_A\)</span>, which is the fancy, statistical way of saying the probability of an event known as A. When flipping a coin, the probability of getting heads was 1/2. You have also learned how to compute the <span class="math inline">\(p_{A or B}\)</span>. This means the probability of either A or B happening. When rolling a dice, <span class="math inline">\(p_{1 or 2}\)</span>–the probability of getting a 1 or a 2–was 1/3.</p>
<p>What if you flipped 2 coins? You know that the probability of getting heads once is 1/2, but what are the odds of getting heads 2 times in a row? Let’s take a look at this tree diagram. We read this diagram from left to right. On the left, the probability of getting heads is 0.5. Now the tree branches out.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>If</em> we got heads the first time, then we go up the top branch. The probability of getting heads again is 0.5.</li>
<li>
<em>If</em> we got tails the first time, then we go down the bottom branch. The probability of getting heads is 0.5.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how regardless of what we get the first time we flip the coin, the probability of getting heads is 0.5 throughout. This suggests that the coin flips are <strong>independent</strong>. The result of one coin flip does not impact the likelihood of getting the same result next time. Take a look at the tree diagram. <span class="math inline">\(p_{H given H}\)</span> represents the probability of getting heads <em>given</em> that we got heads the first time. <span class="math inline">\(p_{H given T}\)</span> represents the probability of getting heads <em>given</em> that we got tails the first time. <span class="math inline">\(p_{H given H}\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(p_{H given T}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Now imagine that 60% of people in a community have a disease. A doctor develops a test to determine if a random person has the disease. However, this test isn’t 100% accurate. This test is 80% sure of correctly returning positive <strong>if the person has the disease</strong> and 90% sure of correctly returning negative <strong>if the person does not have the disease</strong>.</p>
<p>This tree diagram illustrates exactly this. Starting from the left, we see that the probability of a random person having the disease is 0.6. Since they either have the disease or don’t (those are the only two possibilities), the probability that they don’t have the disease is 1 - 0.4.</p>
<p>Now the tree branches out.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>If</em> the random person has the disease, then we go down the top branch. The probability of the person testing positive is 0.8 because the test is 80% sure of correctly returning positive when the person has the disease.</li>
<li>By the same logic, <em>if</em> the random person does not have the disease, we go down the bottom branch. The probability of the person incorrectly testing positive is 0.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>We decide to go down the top branch <em>if</em> our random person has the disease. We go down the bottom branch <em>if</em> they do not. This is called <strong>conditional probability</strong>. The probability of testing positive is <strong>dependent</strong> on whether the person has the disease.</p>
<p>How would you express this in statistical notation? <span class="math inline">\(p(A|B)\)</span> is the same thing as the probability of A <em>given</em> B. <span class="math inline">\(p(A|B)\)</span> essentially means the probability of A <em>if</em> we know for sure the value of B. You should also remember that <span class="math inline">\(p(A|B)\)</span> is not the same thing as <span class="math inline">\(p(B|A)\)</span>.</p>

<!--TW: Need to find another up-to-date example for conditional probabality.

This concept of conditional probability is relevant in our everyday lives. For example, the probability of Trump’s re-election might be different than the probability of Trump’s re-election given that we are in a recession. The probability of you reading a textbook might vary, depending on the likelihood of your instructor cold-calling you in class. Whenever you encounter a question involving conditional probability, drawing a tree diagram is a very useful approach to visualization. -->

### Two diagrams for one set of coin flips

In our histogram probability distribution, we didn’t care what combinations of numbers made each sum. We only cared about the outcome. There are two ways of thinking about a coin toss as well. Your tree diagram should look different depending on whether the order of the results matters.

To understand tree diagrams a little better, imagine you’re flipping 2 coins. Your tree diagram may look different depending what you’re interested in measuring. In the following figure, the order of your coin toss results does not matter. We can imagine that you are rolling two coins together, or that you only care about the sum of the two dice values.

<img src="05-probability/images/tree-3.png" width="100%" />

In the next figure figure below, the order of your coin toss results does matter. Depending on your first result, you go down a different branch.

<!-- DK: Change this example so that 1% is not used twice, both for the prevalence of the disease and the accuracy of the test. -->
<p>You are in a city of 100,000 people. It is true that exactly 1% of the population has a disease, but we don’t know which people have it and which do not. In terms of a count, that means 1,000 people have this disease of the 100,000 in the population. We have a test which is 99% accurate. That is, if you have the disease there is a 99% chance that the test reports that you do, and the same if you don’t have the disease.</p>
<p>So, of the 1,000 people who truly do have the disease — where 1,000 is 1% of the 100,000 people in the city — 990 would correctly test positive and 10 would incorrectly test negative. This city also has 99,000 people who do not have the disease, 990 of which incorrectly test positive and 98,010 of which correctly test negative. That means that the number of people who would test positive for the disease is 1,980 but <em>only 990 of them have the disease</em>. So, in simple terms, the probability of you having the disease given a positive test is <span class="math inline">\(990\div1980\)</span>!</p>
<p>Here is the joint empirical distribution of the test result and disease status. Note that this is an unnormalized distribution because each dot represents a person in this city.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-392-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Here is a joint distribution displayed in 3D. Instead of using the “jitter” feature in R to unstack the dots, we are using a 3D plot to visualize the number of dots in each box. The number of people who correctly test negative in this city is 98,010, far outweighing any of the other categories. There are 990 false positives, 990 true positives, and only 10 false negatives. This is why we can barely see the 3D bar coming from those sections.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="05-probability/images/rayshader_disease.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>This section is called “Two Models” because, for each person, there are two possible states of the world: have the disease and not have the disease. By assumption, there are no other possibilities. We call these two possible states of the world “models,” even though they are very simple models.</p>
<p>In addition to the two models, we have two possible results of our experiment on a given person: test positive or test negative. Again, this is an assumption. We do not allow for any other outcome. In later sections, we will look at more complex situations where we consider more than two models and more than two possible results of the experiment. In the meantime, we have built the <em>unnormalized joint distribution for models and results</em>. This is a key point! Look back earlier in this chapter where we discussed both unnormalized distributions and joint distributions.</p>
<p>Getting back to the figure, what is the difference between these distributions? How can they be useful in data analysis?</p>
<p>We want to analyze these plots by looking at different slices. For instance, let’s say that you have tested positive for the disease. Since the test is not always accurate, you cannot be 100% certain that you have it. We would isolate the slice where the test result equals 1 (meaning positive). If we zoom in on the plot, 990 people who tested positive have the disease and 990 who tested positive do not have the disease. In this case, we are focusing on one slice of the probability distribution where the test result was positive. There are two disease outcomes: positive or negative. By isolating a section, we are looking at a conditional distribution. Conditional on a positive test, you can visualize the likelihood of actually having the disease versus not.</p>
<p>This is what looks like when we take the slice where the test result is positive and zoom in. Taking a slice is the same thing as creating the conditional probability distribution.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="05-probability/images/rayshader_disease_zoom.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>We should rotate this slice and look at it from a 2D perspective. This looks very similar to what we saw at the beginning of the chapter when we flipped coins to create a probability distribution.</p>

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="05-probability/images/marble.jpg" width="100%"></div>
<p>Imagine that your friend gives you a bag with two marbles. There could either be two white marbles, two black marbles, or one of each color. Thus, the bag could contain 0% white marbles, 50% white marbles, or 100% white marbles. The proportion, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, of white marbles could be 0, 0.5, or 1.</p>
<p>Let’s say you take a marble out of the bag, record whether it’s black or white, then return it to the bag. You repeat this three times, observing the number of white marbles you see out of three trials. You could get three whites, two whites, one white, or zero whites as a result of this trial. Let’s make what we call a Bayes scatterplot out of this. We have three models (three different proportions of white marbles in the bag) and four possible experimental results.</p>
<p>Here is the scatterplot visualization of the scenario:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-398-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Here is the 3D visualization:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="05-probability/images/three_models.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>The y-axes of both the scatterplot and the 3D visualization are labeled “Number of White Marbles in the Bag.” This is a model, a belief about the world you are not sure of. For instance. When the model is 0, we have no white marbles in the bag, meaning that none of the marbles we pull out in the sample will be white.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve got zero white marbles. We would isolate the slice where the result of the simulation involves three black marbles and zero white ones. Here is the unnormalized probability distribution.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-400-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Next, let’s normalize the distribution.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-401-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>This plot makes sense because when all three marbles you draw out of the bag are NOT white, there is a pretty good chance that there are no white marbles in the bag. There is a smaller chance that the bag contains one black marble and one white marble. However, there is no chance that the bag only contains white marbles.</p>

<!-- 5 a) Now go on to Rethinking approach. I think that chapter 2 is just genius. Bayesian is really just counting. Maybe we do a very similar example to what he does? Maybe different? I am still pondering this myself. I think that there is a deep relationship here. In the simple Bayes rule decision trees, we know all the probabilities. But what if we don't? Instead, we get to observe lots of data (which are counts!) and then, from that data, figure out the probabilities. (Note that Rethinking does not talk like this --- after all, we know all the probabilities since each marble has a 20% chance of being drawn --- but I think it is implicit in his approach.) Key issue: Can we connect this in a sensible way to Bayesian scatterplot. There is always the data and the model and the relationship between the two. (And "the model" means, mainly, the parameter estimates thereof.) Tell me the data, and I will tell you the model. Tell me the model, and I will tell you the model. -->
<!-- Note the connection between the marbles from Rethinking and the Bayesian scatterplot. In figure 2.2 in Rethinking represents the model where p = 0.25, where p is the proportion of blue marbles in the total collection. The y-axis models would be labeled with p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. With the tree marble diagram in figure 2.2, we would be taking random samples with 3 marbles. The number of blue marbles we get each time would be plotted along p = 0.25. This is another example of model on the y-axis and data on the x-axis. -->
<!-- DK: Should we cut out p = 0 and p = 1 as too annoying to deal with? -->
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="05-probability/images/heads.jpg" width="100%"></div>
<p>Assume that there is a coin with <span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span>. I guarantee that there are only 11 possible values of <span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, 1\)</span>. In other words, there are 11 possible models, 11 things which might be true about the world. This is just like situations we have previously discussed, except that there are more models to consider.</p>
<p>We are going to run an experiment in which you flip the coin 20 times and record the number of heads. What does this result tell you about the value of <span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span>? Ultimately, we will want to calculate a posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span>, which is written as p(<span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span>).</p>
<p>To start, it is useful to consider all the things which might happen if, for example, <span class="math inline">\(p_h = 0.4\)</span>. Fortunately, the R functions for simulating random variables makes this easy.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-403-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>First, notice that many different things can happen! Even if we <em>know</em>, for certain, that <span class="math inline">\(p_h = 0.4\)</span>, many outcomes are possible. Life is remarkably random. Second, the most likely result of the experiment is 8 heads, as we would expect. Third, we have transformed the raw counts of how many times each total appeared into a probability distribution. Sometimes, however, it is convenient to just keep track of the raw counts. The shape of the figure is the same in both cases.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-404-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Either way, the figures show what would have happened if that model — that <span class="math inline">\(p_h = 0.4\)</span> — were true.</p>
<p>We can do the same thing for all 11 possible models, calculating what would happen if each of them were true. This is somewhat counterfactual since only one of them can be true. Yet this assumption does allow us to create the <em>joint distribution</em> of <em>models which might be true</em> and of <em>data which our experiment might generate</em>. Let’s simplify this is p(models, data), although you should keep the precise meaning in mind.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-405-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Here is the 3D version of the same plot.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="05-probability/images/n_models.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>In both of these idagrams, we see 11 models and 21 outcomes. We don’t really care about the p(<span class="math inline">\(models\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(data\)</span>), the joint distribution of the models-which-might-be-true and the data-which-our-experiment-might-generate. Instead, we want to estimate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the unknown parameter which determines the probability that this coin will come up heads when tossed. The joint distribution alone can’t tell us that. We <em>created</em> the joint distribution before we had even conducted the experiment. It is our creation, a tool which we use to make inferences. Instead, we want the conditional distribution, p(<span class="math inline">\(models\)</span> | <span class="math inline">\(data = 8\)</span>). We have the results of the experiment. What do those results tell us about the probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we simply take a vertical <em>slice</em> from the joint distribution at the point of the x-axis corresponding to the results of the experiment.</p>
<p>This animation shows what we want to do with joint distributions. We take a slice (the red one), isolate it, rotate it to look at the conditional distribution, normalize it (change the values along the current z-axis from counts to probabilities), then observe the resulting posterior.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="05-probability/animations/color_red_combo.gif"></div>
<p>This is the only part of the joint distribution that we care about. We aren’t interested in what the object looks like where, for example, the number of heads is 11. That portion is irrelevant because we observed 8 heads, not 11. By using the filter function on the simulation tibble we created, we can conclude that there are a total of 465 times in our simulation in which 8 heads were observed.</p>
<p>As we would expect, most of the time when 8 coin tosses came up heads, the value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> was 0.4. But, on numerous occasions, it was not. It is quite common for a value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> like 0.3 or 0.5 to generate 8 heads. Consider:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-407-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Yet this is a distribution of raw counts. It is an unnormalized density. To turn it into a proper probability density (i.e., one in which the sum of the probabilities across possible outcomes sums to one) we just divide everything by the total number of observations.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-408-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>The most likely value of <span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span> is still 0.4, as before. But, it is much more likely that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is either 0.3 or 0.5. And there is about an 8% chance that <span class="math inline">\(p_h \ge 0.6\)</span>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering: what is the use of a model? Well, let’s say we toss the coin 20 times and get 8 heads again. Given this result, what is the probability that future samples of 20 flips will result in 10 or more heads?</p>
<p>There are three main ways you could go about solving this problem with simulations.</p>
<p>The first <em>wrong</em> way to do this is assuming that <span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span> is certain because we observed 8 heads after 20 tosses. We would conclude that 8/20 gives us 0.4. The big problem with this is that you are ignoring your uncertainty when estimating <span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span>. This would lead us to the following code.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, if you calculated the value using the first method, you would believe that getting 10 or more heads is less likely than it really is. If you were to run a casino based on these assumptions, you will lose all your money. It is very important to be careful about the assumptions you are making. We tossed a coin 20 times and got 8 heads. However, you would be wrong to assume that <span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span> = 0.4 just based on this result.</p>
<!-- ## Testing is evil -->
<!-- Introduce concepts like the null model, testing, and p-values. Connect to permutation tests from chapter 3.  Side note quotation: "Amatuers test. Professionals summarize."

<!-- In some fields, it is common to want to test a specific hypothesis. Consider the hypothesis that the coin is fair, i.e., that $p = 0.5$. Does the data we have support or reject that hypothesis?

<p>The four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues">Cardinal Virtues</a> are Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Temperance. Because data science is, ultimately, a moral act, we use these virtues to guide our work. <em>Wisdom</em> highlights the importance of exploring your data. Given the questions you seek to answer, is the data valid? Is it representative? Is it ethical to proceed? <em>Justice</em> focuses on the Preceptor Table and the mathematical structure of the model. The virtue of <em>Courage</em> allows us to go from words and math to code, the hardest step in the data science process. <em>Temperance</em> guides us in the use of the model we have created to answer the questions we began with. We should be modest in the claims we make, and wary of naive attempts to “test” them.</p>

<p>Wisdom encompasses four topics: data, validity, , the population and ethics.</p>
<p>First, we look at the data and perform an exploratory data analysis, an EDA. You can never look at your data too much.</p>
<p>Second, confirm that the data we have accurately capturing the concepts we care about. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-roas" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-roas" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most important is that the data you are analyzing should map to the research question you are trying to answer. This sounds obvious but is often overlooked or ignored because it can be inconvenient. Optimally, this means that the outcome measure should accurately reflect the phenomenon of interest, the model should include all relevant predictors, and the model should generalize to the cases to which it will be applied.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, with regard to the outcome variable, a model of incomes will not necessarily tell you about patterns of total assets. A model of test scores will not necessarily tell you about child intelligence or cognitive development. …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A sample that is representative of all mothers and children may not be the most appropriate for making inferences about mothers and children who participate in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. … Similarly, results regarding diet and exercise obtained from a study performed on patients at risk for heart disease may not be generally applicable to generally healthy individuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want there to be a connection between the problem we face and the data we have. But desire is a poor replacement for substance. If the data we have is not relevant, then data science is useless.</p>
<p>Third, a key concept is the “population,” which is largely equivalent to the rows of the ideal Preceptor Table, as discussed in Chapter <a href="rubin-causal-model.html#rubin-causal-model">4</a>. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-roas" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-roas" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> writes:</p>
<!-- DK: This is not bad, but needs to be re-written. -->
<blockquote>
<p>A regression model is fit to data and is used to make inferences about a larger population, hence the implicit assumption in interpreting regression coefficients is that the sample is representative of the population.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be more precise, the key assumption is that the data are representative of the distribution of the outcome <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> given the predictors <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, …, that are included in the model. For example, in a regression of earnings on height and sex, it would be acceptable for women and tall people to be overrepresented in the sample, compared to the general population, but problems would arise if the sample includes too many rich people. Selection on x does not interfere with inferences from the regression model, but selection on y does. This is one motivation to include more predictors in our regressions, to allow the assumption of representativeness, conditional on X, to be more reasonable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Representativeness is a concern even with data that would not conventionally be considered as a sample. For example, the forecasting model in Section 7.1 contains data from 16 consecutive elections, and these are not a sample from anything, but one purpose of the model is to predict future elections. Using the regression fit to past data to predict the next election is mathematically equivalent to considering the observed data and the new outcome as a random sample from a hypothetical superpopulation. Or, to be more precise, it is like treating the errors as a random sample from the normal error distribution. For another example, if a regression model is fit to data from the 50 states, we are not interested in making predictions for a hypothetical 51st state, but you may well be interested in the hypothetical outcome in the 50 states in a future year. As long as some generalization is involved, ideas of statistical sampling arise, and we need to think about representativeness of the sample to the implicit or explicit population about which inferences will be drawn. This is related to the idea of generative modeling, as discussed in Section 4.1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Validity is about the columns in our tibble. Representativeness is about the rows.</p>
<p>Fourth, even if we can make a model, we should always ask ourselves: Should we? Ethics matter.</p>

<!-- DK: Could have more here. -->
<p>Precision matters. What do you know and what do you want to know? Creating a Preceptor Table forces you to be clear about what you are trying to accomplish and the problems you will face along the way.</p>
<p><strong>A Preceptor Table is a table with rows and columns for all the data that we have and would (reasonably) like to have.</strong> If we had a Preceptor Table with no questions marks — which we describe below as the ideal Preceptor Table — we could calculate the number we want without the need for any inference.</p>
<p>First, the infinite Preceptor Table is well described in Chapter <a href="rubin-causal-model.html#rubin-causal-model">4</a>. We never use these, but it useful to understand them, and the assumptions we must make to work with something simpler.</p>
<p>Second, the ideal Preceptor Table is the Preceptor Table with no question marks, and with a reasonable number of rows and columns. Conceptually, this is the heart of the analysis.</p>
<p>Third, the actual Preceptor Table is the Preceptor Table with all the annoying question marks which the real world saddles us with.</p>
<p>The central problem in inference is to fill in the question marks on the actual Preceptor Table.</p>
<p>Note that the concept of a Preceptor Table is more subtle than it at first appears. For example, consider a problem in which we are using <code>party</code> to predict <code>income</code> with the <code>trains</code> data. Naively, it might look like we don’t have any question marks. For all 115 rows in the data, we have <code>party</code> and <code>income</code>. But the Preceptor Table we really need has more than 115 rows because we are trying to draw inferences about people not in the sample of 115. What if a new person shows up, tells us their party, and asks us to guess their income? The ideal Preceptor Table would include their row, with the data for <code>party</code> present but the data for <code>income</code> a question mark.</p>

<div id="predictive-versus-causal-models" class="section level4" number="5.6.2.2">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">5.6.2.2</span> Predictive versus causal models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#predictive-versus-causal-models"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Are we are modeling (just) for prediction or are we (also) modeling for causation? Predictive models care nothing about causation. Causal models are often also concerned with prediction, if only as a means of measuring the quality of the model.</p>
<p>Every model is predictive, in the sense that, if we give you new data — and it is drawn from a stable distribution — then you can create a predictive forecast. But only a subset of those models are causal, meaning that, for a given individual, you can change the value of one input and figure out what the new output would be and then, from that, calculate the causal effect.</p>
<p>With prediction, all we care about is forecasting Y given X on some as-yet-unseen data — implying that the Preceptor Table has rows in which we know all the X but not the Y. But there is no notion of “manipulation” in such models. We don’t pretend that, for Joe, we could turn variable X from a value of 5 to a value of 30 by just turning some knob and, by doing so, cause Joe’s value of Y to change from 17 to 23. We can compare two people (or two groups of people), one with X equal to 5 and one with X equal to 30, and see how they differ in Y. The basic assumption of predictive models is that there is only one possible Y for Joe. There are not, by assumption, two possible values for Y, one if X equal 5 and another if X equals 30. The Preceptor Table has a single column under Y.</p>
<p>With causal inference, however, we can consider the case of Joe with <span class="math inline">\(X = 5\)</span> and Joe with <span class="math inline">\(X = 30\)</span>. The same mathematical model can be used. And both models can be used for prediction, for estimating what the value of Y will be for a yet-unseen observation with values X. But, in this case, instead of only a single column in the Preceptor Table for Y, we have at least two (and possibly many) such columns, one for each of the potential outcomes under consideration.</p>
<p><em>The difference between prediction models and causal models is that the former have one column for Y and the latter have more than one.</em></p>
<p>A related issue is the different types of Preceptor Tables. All of these are Preceptor Tables, but it is useful, I think, to have a clear description of the different types.</p>

<p><em>Justice</em> requires (simple) math. Consider a model of coin-tossing:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ T_i  \sim B(p_H, n = 20) \]</span>
The total number <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of Heads in experiment <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with 20 flips of a single coin, <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span>, is distributed as a binomial with <span class="math inline">\(n = 20\)</span> and an unknown probability <span class="math inline">\(p_H\)</span> of the coin coming up Heads.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a cheat and a simplification! We are Bayesians but we have not specified the full Bayesian machinery. We really need priors on the unknown parameter <span class="math inline">\(p_H\)</span> as well. But that is too complex for an introductory class, so we wave our hands, accept the default sesinvle parameters built into the functions we use and point readers to more advanced books, like <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-roas" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-roas" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Defining <span class="math inline">\(p_H\)</span> as the “the probability that the coin comes up Heads” is a bit of a fudge. If you calculate that by hand and then compare it to what our tools produce, they won’t be the same. Instead, the calcualted value will be closer to zero. Why? <span class="math inline">\(p_H\)</span> is really the “long-run percentage of the time the coin comes up Heads.” It is not just the percentage from this experiment.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- DK: too complex for this chapter? --><ul>
<li>In this simple case, we are fortunate that the parameter <span class="math inline">\(p_H\)</span> has such a (mostly!) simple analog to a real world quantity. Much of the time, parameters are not so easy to interpret. In a more complex model, especially with one with interaction terms, we focus less on parameters and more on actual predictions.</li>

<p>The three languages of data science are words, math and code, and the most important of these is code. We need to explain the structure of our model using all three languages, but we need <em>Courage</em> to implement the model in code.</p>
<p>Code allows us to “fit” a model by estimating the values of the unknown parameters, like <span class="math inline">\(p_H\)</span>. Sadly, we can never know the true values of these parameters. But, like all good data scientists, we can express our uncertain knowledge in the form of posterior probability distributions. With those distributions, we can compare the actual values of the outcome variable with the “fitted” or “predicted” results of the model. We can examine the “residuals,” the difference between the fitted and actual values.</p>
<p>Every outcome is the sum of two parts: the model and what is not in the model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[outcome = model + what\ is\ not\ in\ the\ model\]</span></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what the outcome is. It could be the result of a coin flip, the weight of a person, the GDP of a country. Whatever <em>outcome</em> we are considering is always made up of two parts. The first is the model we have created. The second is all the stuff — all the blooming and buzzing complexity of the real world — which is not a part of the model.</p>
<p>Some of our uncertainty is driven by our ignorance about <span class="math inline">\(p_H\)</span>.</p>
<p>A parameter is something which does not exist in the real world. (If it did, or could, then it would be data.) Instead, a parameter is a mental abstraction, a building block which we will use to to help us accomplish our true goal: To replace at least some of the questions marks in the Preceptor Table. Since parameters are mental abstractions, we will always be uncertain as to their value, however much data we might collect.</p>
<p>But some, often most, of the uncertainty comes from forces that are, by assumption, not in the model. For example, if the coin is fair, we expect <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> to equal 10. But, often, it will be different, even if we are correct and <span class="math inline">\(p_H\)</span> equals exactly 0.5. <em>Some randomness is intrinsic in this fallen world.</em></p>

<p>There are few more important concepts in statistics and data science than the “Data Generating Mechanism.” Our <em>data</em> — the data that we collect and see — has been <em>generated</em> by the complexity and confusion of the world. God’s own <em>mechanism</em> has brought His data to us. Our job is to build a model of that process, to create, on the computer, a mechanism which generates fake data consistent with the data which we see. With that DGM, we can answer any question which we might have. In particular, with the DGM, we provide predictions of data we have not seen and estimates of the uncertainty associated with those predictions. <em>Courage</em> helped us to create the DGM. <em>Temperance</em> will guide us in its use.</p>
<p>Having created (and checked) a model, we now use the model to answer questions. Models are made for use, not for beauty. The world confronts us. Make decisions we must. Our decisions will be better ones if we use high quality models to help make them.</p>
<p>Sadly, our models are never as good as we would like them to be. First, the world is intrinsically uncertain.</p>

<p>What we really care about is data we haven’t seen yet, mostly data from tomorrow. But what if the world changes, as it always does? If it doesn’t change much, maybe we are OK.

<p>What does this mean? Well imagine a crowd playing Three Card Monte in the streets of New York. The guy running the game runs a demo and shows you all the cards to make you confident. They earn money by making you overconfident and persuading you to bet. Your odds may seem good during the demo round, but that doesn’t actually say anything about what will likely happen when the real, high stakes game begins. The person running the game does many simulations, making the “victim” forget that they cannot actually make any conclusions about the odds of winning. There are some variables that we simply do not know even if we put a lot of effort into making posterior probability distributions. People can be using slight of hand, for instance.</p>
<p>We need patience in order to study and understand the unknown unknowns in our data. Patience is also important when we analyze the “realism” of our models. When we created the mathematical probability distribution for presidential elections, for instance, we assumed that the Democratic candidate would have a 50% chance of winning each vote in the electoral college. By comparing the mathematical model to our empirical cases, however, we recognize that the mathematical model is unlikely to be true. The mathematical model suggested that getting fewer than 100 votes is next to impossible, but many past Democratic candidates in the empirical distribution received less than 100 electoral votes.</p>
<!-- DK: Could do more here. Show the iterative process of model building, including posterior predictive checks. -->
<!-- Null hypothesis testing is a mistake. There is only the data, the models and the summaries therefrom. Describe an hypothesis test each chapter, and then dismiss it. Play the prediction game. That, perhaps, provides a useful framework for why NHST is stupid. Or, rather, you play the prediction game to figure out which statistical procedures are best --- and or, how well procedure X works --- and then use that information to make a decision. Explain what a test is, and why we think it is a waste of time to do them, and why people do them anyway. Key issue: If p = 0.04 really makes you do something totally different than p = 0.06, then either you (or the system within which you are operating) is stupid. -->

<p>Throughout this chapter, we spent time going through examples of conditional distributions. However, it’s worth noting that all probability distributions are conditional on something. Even in the most simple examples, when we were flipping a coin multiple times, we were assuming that the probability of getting heads versus tails did not change between tosses.</p>
<p>We also discussed the difference between empirical, mathematical, and posterior probability distributions. Even though we developed these heuristics to better understand distributions, every time we make a claim about the world, it is based on our beliefs - what we think about the world. We could be wrong. Our beliefs can differ. Two reasonable people can have conflicting beliefs about the fairness of a die.</p>
<p>It is useful to understand the three types of distributions and the concept of conditional distributions, but almost every probability distribution is conditional and posterior. We can leave out both words in future discussions, as we generally will in this book. They are implicit.</p>
<p>If you are keen to learn more about probability, here is a video featuring Professor Gary King. This is a great way to review some of the concepts we covered in this chapter, albeit at a higher level of mathematics.</p>
